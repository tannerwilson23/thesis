	abstract = {Stars between two and three solar masses rotate rapidly on the main sequence, and the detection of slow core and surface rotation in the core-helium burning phase for these stars places strong constraints on their angular momentum transport and loss. From a detailed asteroseismic study of the mixed-dipole mode pattern in a carefully selected, representative sample of stars, we find that slow core rotation rates in the range reported by prior studies are a general phenomenon and not a selection effect. We show that the core rotation rates of these stars decline strongly with decreasing surface gravity during the core He-burning phase. We argue that this is a model-independent indication of significant rapid angular momentum transport between the cores and envelopes of these stars. We see a significant range in core rotation rates at all surface gravities, with little evidence for a convergence towards a uniform value. We demonstrate using evolutionary models that measured surface rotation periods are a biased tracer of the true surface rotation distribution, and argue for using stellar models for interpreting the contrast between core and surface rotation rates. The core rotation rates we measure do not have a strong mass or metallicity dependence. We argue that the emerging data strongly favors a model where angular momentum transport is much more efficient during the core He burning phase than in the shell burning phases which precede and follow it.},

	abstract = {Rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, with far reaching consequences for stellar evolution. Nitrogen surface abundances for a large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the {LMC} were obtained by the {VLT}-{FLAMES} Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a broad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough sample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis. We use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of rotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution models, using the {FLAMES} sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing processes. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid to simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational velocity distributions consistent with those from the {FLAMES} sample. The synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results and theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars without significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators with enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally. Furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical processes appear to be required to understand the population of massive main-sequence stars from the {FLAMES} sample.We discuss the possible role of binary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary systems},

The additional seven observed variables considered here are their surface nitrogen abundance, rotational frequency, magnetic field strength, and the amplitude and frequency of their dominant acoustic and gravity mode of oscillation. Multiple linear regression to estimate the nitrogen abundance combined with principal components analysis, after addressing the incomplete and truncated nature of the data, reveals that the effective temperature and the frequency of the dominant acoustic oscillation mode are the only two significant predictors for the nitrogen abundance, while the projected rotational velocity and the rotational frequency have no predictive power. The dominant gravity mode and the magnetic field strength are correlated with the effective temperature but have no predictive power for the nitrogen abundance. Our findings are completely based on observations and their proper statistical treatment and call for a new strategy in evaluating the outcome of stellar evolution computations.},

	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textasciitilde} 12 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M \&gt;{\textasciitilde} 40 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like'' track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}cite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}cite\{Lyu96\}).},

	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, five appear to be Li-rich because they have not completed the standard first dredge-up dilution, and three have abundances compatible with the maximum allowed by standard dilution. Thus, these should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. At this evolutionary phase, the outwardly-moving hydrogen shell burns through the mean molecular weight discontinuity created by the first dredge-up. Any extra-mixing process can now easily connect the {\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}3{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}He-rich envelope material to the outer regions of the hydrogen-burning shell, enabling Li production by the Cameron \&amp; Fowler (1971) process. While very high Li abundances are then reached, this Li-rich phase is extremely short lived because once the mixing extends deep enough to lower the carbon isotopic ratio below the standard dilution value, the freshly synthesized Li is quickly destroyed. In intermediate-mass stars, the mean molecular weight gradient due to the first dredge-up is not erased until after the star has begun to burn helium in its core. The Li-rich phase in these stars occurs when the convective envelope deepens at the base of the {AGB}, permitting extra-mixing to play an effective role. Li production ceases when a strong mean molecular weight gradient is built up between the deepening convective envelope and the shell of nuclear burning that surrounds the inert {CO} core. This episode is also very short lived. Low-mass stars may undergo additional mixing at this phase. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

	abstract = {Many stars exhibit strong magnetic fields, some of which are thought to be of primordial origin and others a sign of magnetic dynamo processes. We briefly review the results of observational studies of solar-type stars seeking to evaluate the linkage between rotation rate and possible magnetic cycles of activity. Clearly turbulent convection and rotation within spherical shell geometries provide ingredients essential for dynamo action. However, intensive efforts over several decades in solar research have demonstrated that it is no easy matter to achieve cyclic magnetic activity that is in accord with observations. Helioseismology has revealed that an essential element for the global solar dynamo is the presence of a tachocline of shear at the base of the solar convection zone, leading to the likely operation of an interface dynamo. We review the crucial elements for achieving a cyclic magnetic activity. We then discuss some of our current 3 D {MHD} simulations of solar turbulent convection in spherical shells that yield differential rotation profiles which make good contact with some of the helioseismic findings. We show that such turbulent motions can amplify and sustain magnetic field in the bulk of the convective zone whose strength are sufficient to feed back both upon the convection and its global circulations.},

	abstract = {Double-lined eclipsing binaries with accurate absolute dimensions are the best stellar data to test tidal evolution theories due to the high dependency of the time scales on masses, relative radii and periods. In a preceding paper we have probed the hydrodynamical mechanism against the observed levels of synchronization and circularization for about 40 close binary systems with accurate absolute dimensions. In the present work we extend our investigations, using the same systems as a control, to the turbulent dissipation and radiative damping mechanisms which have been studied by Zahn. The time scales for these processes are characterized by the parameters λ\_2\_ and E\_2\_ respectively. These parameters were computed for a wide grid of stellar models and they are presented, for the first time, as functions of the mass and time. The differential equations which govern the orbital parameters were integrated using our recent grids of stellar models (Claret 1995A\&amp;{AS}..109..441C, 1997, A\&amp;{AS} submitted; Claret \&amp; Gimenez 1995A\&amp;A...296..180C, 1995A\&amp;{AS}..114..549C). The derived critical times and radii were compared with observations of synchronization and circularization levels. Within uncertainties, the formalisms by Zahn seem to be able to explain the eccentricity distribution around the zero point of the diagram log (age/t\_cri\_) x eccentricity although they can not explain some systems with circular orbits which present ages smaller than their respective critical times. We have also introduced a diagram based on the integration of the differential equations which proved to be useful to test theoretical predictions for the relationship age x Period (cut-off) for clusters. Using this diagram we have shown that the turbulent friction mechanism is not dissipative enough to explain such an observational relationship. However, as these results are valid only for little departure from synchronism and small eccentricity, we plan to investigate the influence of the initial conditions in a forthcoming paper.},

It is demonstrated that most of the orbital circularization occurs during the Hayashi phase, and that the subsequent decrease in eccentricity on the main-sequence is negligible. The theoretical cutoff period, which separates the circular from the eccentric systems, lies between 7.2 and 8.5 days, depending on the masses and on the assumptions made about the initial conditions; it agrees well with the observed period of about 8 days. This cutoff period is a function of the initial radius of the stars on the Hayashi track. In these calculations, the values predicted by the star formation theory of Stahler et al. (1980) are used; hence the good agreement mentioned above provides a new validation of that theory. It is also shown that systems around that cutoff period reach the zero-age main-sequence with their components rotating faster than the orbital rate.},

The rate of turbulent diffusion in the unstable regions of these models is so rapid that it appears to preclude a fast-spinning solar interior. As a corollary of the stability analysis, we conclude that the loss of a significant fraction of a star's angular momentum must be accompanied by the mixing of material below its convective zone.

The turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, with stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical, thereby enforcing a rotation rate which depends only on depth, to first approximation. This conjecture is supported by the interior rotation of the Sun, which is now being revealed through acoustic sounding. The main result is that both the meridian circulation and the turbulence are determined by the loss of angular momentum, which the author ascribes here solely to a stellar wind. When there is no wind, the meridian flow is very weak, and it can even vanish in slow rotators. When the wind is active, it drives the circulation in order to transport angular momentum to the surface, but the advection of chemical species by this flow is partly inhibited because of the horizontal turbulence.},

	abstract = {Models of stellar evolution with rotation are very much needed in order to interpret recent stellar properties, in particular for massive stars. For that we proceed to a detailed investigation of some critical physical processes in rotating stars: 1. The equation expressing the transport of angular momentum by circulation and diffusion is revised to also account for expansion and contraction in non-stationary models. 2. We examine the current expressions for the velocity U(r) of the meridional circulation, also taking into account mu -gradients and horizontal turbulence. We show that there are no ``mu -currents'' but just meridional currents which can be sizeably influenced by the gradients of mean molecular weight mu . A proper account of the mu -gradients may reduce U(r) by one or two orders of magnitude with respect to current expressions. 3. While the usual expressions for the meridional circulation would predict an infinite velocity at the edge of a radiative and semiconvective zone and an inverted circulation in a semiconvective zone, the present developments give a continuity of the solutions for the circulation. 4. The approximation of a stationary circulation, which is no longer valid after the main-sequence phase, is also removed and the case of a general equation of state is considered. We notice that in the stationary regime the horizontal fluctuations of mu represent some fixed fraction of the vertical mu -gradient. To first order, this fraction is not dependent on rotation, because the building of horizontal fluctuations by the circulation is compensated by the smoothing due to horizontal turbulence.},

	abstract = {The weak friction model for tidal interaction in a close binary system is investigated, in which the tides assume their equilibrium shape, but with a constant time lag, and the model is used to derive explicit equations of tidal evolution. An elementary derivation is presented of the perturbing tidal forces, and the perturbations are used to derive differential equations for the evolution of several orbital and rotational parameters of the binary system. Energy and angular momentum considerations are used directly instead of the general perturbation techniques of celestial mechanics. The tidal evolution equations are analyzed locally around equilibrium configurations. Time scales are derived for the rate of change of the semimajor axis, the rotational velocity, and for the eccentricity and inclination, which go to zero asymptotically. The global aspects of the tidal evolution equations are analyzed. For the case of small inclinations but arbitrary eccentricity, a complete classification is made of all types of tidal evolution possible in the model which is presented. Several relations are obtained analytically from the equations for tidal evolution in the weak friction model. The presented model is simple, but it is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide class of binary stars},

The interior and envelope solutions in this procedure are derived in Sections 2 and 3. The results apply to stars which have a convective core and a radiative envelope, and they are discussed in Section 4. We find that the resonances of the free gravity modes are damped by radiative dissipation, which operates in a relatively thin region below the surface of the star. Due to that dissipation, some properties of the dynamical tide have observable consequences in close binary systems: (1) A torque is applied to a binary component; this serves to make it corotate with its companion in a time which can be short compared to its nuclear life. (2) Before that synchronization is achieved, the brightness distribution over the surface of the star is in general phase shifted relative to the external driving potential.},

For stars (or planets) with an outer convection zone, the dominant mechanism identified so far is the viscous dissipation acting on the equilibrium tide. For stars with an outer radiation zone, it is the radiative damping operating on the dynamical tide.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005280},
	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We suggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper mixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars, the Li-rich phase occurs on the early-{AGB}. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

It also helps to set constraints for cosmological models. The presence of very strong lithium lines in some giant stars of different spectral types and stages of evolution has been considered up to the end of the nineties as a puzzle. To solve this problem, non standard evolutionary mechanisms must be invoked. We review here all the mechanisms presented in the literature and which are divided into internal and external processes of lithium enrichment. We will also discuss the observational tests which are being performed in order to discard (or not) some of them. In any case, the more realistic values of the lithium abundances in giants are, as we will see, the main test of these proposed scenarios. Because of this importance we discuss here the state of art of the Non-{LTE} determinations of lithium abundances in strong lithium giants. Evolved giants, with lithium abundances larger than that of the interstellar medium and with their important mass losses can be considered the most realistic sources of lithium in the Galaxy. We believe that a complete physical picture of this problem will give a powerful tool to understand the chemical evolution of a large part of all light elements.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of meridional circulation in the radiative zone of a rotating star has been studied. The Eddington-Sweet formulation of the circulation velocity, in which the convective transport of energy by the flow is assumed to compensate for the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux, is confirmed for a "slowly" rotating star. On the other hand, apparent singularities of the circulation velocity in the case = a and near the stellar surface are found to be due to improper uses of the Eddington-Sweet formulation. When the convective transport of energy is inefficient, the energy equation reduces to the thermal conduction equation, in which the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux results in local heating or cooling, and the star manages ot redistribute angular velocity of rotation in such a way that there is no meridional circulation. The Goldreich-Schubert instability destroys the above-mentioned steady rotation, but it is argued that a new steady state is likely to be established in which a balance exists between the meridional circulation and the irregular motion due to this instability. Key words: Eddington-Sweet formulation; Goldreich-Schubert instability; Meridional circulation; Steady rotation.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00645172},
	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the dynamical problem of tidal friction in a binary system consisting of deformable components, with the restriction that the angle of lag or advance of the tidal distortion with respect to the direction of the disturbing companion is small. The fractional distortion of the bodies due to rotation and tidal interaction is also treated as a first-order small quantity, and terms up to the fourth harmonic in the tidal potential are retained. In this linear approximation, the time-dependent tidal potential can be Fourier decomposed into a spectrum of simple harmonic terms, each of which is responsible for raising a ‘partial wave’ in the body; each such partial wave can then be treated independently of the others. This is the method first employed by Darwin. In Section 2, it is assumed that the phase lag in the response of the body (due to dissipation of kinetic energy of deformation) is proportional to the forcing frequency, which is justified for small amplitude oscillations of a viscous fluid or visco-elastic body. A simple expression is then obtained for the potential function for the distortion in terms of the disturbing potential and the structure of the body. In Section 3, the distortion potential function is employed in deriving the {componentsR}, S {andW} of the disturbing force which are then substituted in the Gaussian form of the equations for variation of the elements. In Section 4, the Eulerian equations for motion of deformable bodies are derived, using the so-called ‘mean axes’ of the body as the rotating axes of reference. In Section 5, it is shown that the dynamical effects of rotational distortion occur on a much shorter time scale than those arising from tidal friction, which allows one to consider the two phenomena as acting independently of one another. The collected set of Gaussian (orbital) and Eulerian (body) equations is re-written in terms of dimensionless variables for the tidal friction case, and the stability of the system is examined on the basis of these equations. In Section 6, the tidal friction equations are integrated numerically for the close binary system {AG} Persei and for the Earth-Moon system. In the former, the integrations were started from a highly elliptical orbit and the system was found to relax into a circular orbit, with synchronous rotation perpendicular to the orbit. In the latter, the integrations were performed backwards in time from the present day, and it was found that the lunar orbit rapidly becomes highly elliptical at the time of closest approach, thus indicating a probable capture of the Moon by the Earth. This result is in agreement with that obtained by other investigators; however, it is shown that the detailed behaviour of the system at the time of capture, in particular the inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic, depends critically on the chosen rate of dissipation in the Moon's interior. A simple argument is presented which allows an estimation for the mean viscosity of a fluid body from the known age of the system: for the components of {AG} per, the result is 2×10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}11{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} g cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, indicating that the stars must have possessed turbulent convective outer regions during some part of their tidal evolution, while for the Earth, the result, is 1.4×10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}12{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} g cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. It is shown that the angle of tidal lag in nonsynchronous close binary systems in general is expected to be extremely small, and not observationally detectable.},

The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 {\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}4{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology and asteroseismology of red giant stars have shown that the distribution of angular momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with time remains an open issue in stellar physics. Owing to the unprecedented quality of Kepler photometry, we are able to
seismically infer internal rotation rates in {\textbackslash}gamma Doradus stars, which provide the {MS} counterpart to the red-giants puzzle. We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar evolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used a stellar model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain seismically inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 {\textbackslash}gamma Doradus stars observed by Kepler. We show that the buoyancy radius can be used as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the {MS}. We computed rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in radiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the {CESTAM} code. This code calculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of the {RGB}. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear disagreement between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and the rotation rates obtained from evolutionary models including rotationally induced transport following Zahn (1992). These results show a disagreement similar to that of the Sun and red giant stars. This suggests the existence of missing
mechanisms responsible for the braking of the core before and along the {MS}. The efficiency of the missing mechanisms is investigated. The transport of angular momentum as formalized by Zahn and Maeder cannot explain the measurements of near-core rotation in main-sequence
intermediate-mass stars we have at hand.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201118519},
	abstract = {Context. There are now more than 22 months of long-cadence data 
available for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space
mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in
their oscillation spectra and see many components of the mixed modes
that probe the stellar core. Aims: We report for the first time a
parametric fit to the pattern of the ℓ = 1 mixed modes in red
giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated mixed
modes. With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and
gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the
surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. Methods: We propose
two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the
frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is
used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a
quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between
seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period
échelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the
gravity-dominated mixed modes. Results: The asymptotic relation
for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode
period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The
identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to
complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant
oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true
identification of ℓ = 3 modes, of ℓ = 2 mixed modes, for the
mode widths and amplitudes, and for the ℓ = 1 rotational splittings.
 Conclusions: The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period
spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The
derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is
different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of
the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core
contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored
using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the
mean large separation.

For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios,
predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13
low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode
identifications. Aims: We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. Methods: We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. Results: We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201322779},
	abstract = {Context. We still do not understand which physical mechanisms are 
responsible for the transport of angular momentum inside stars. The
recent detection of mixed modes that contain the clear signature of
rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and red giants gives us the
opportunity to make progress on this question. Aims: Our aim is
to probe the radial dependence of the rotation profiles for a sample of
Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants are
particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are
more sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case
for their more evolved counterparts. Methods: We first extracted
the rotational splittings and frequencies of the modes for six young
Kepler red giants. We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars
using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed
splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted
the internal rotation profiles of the six stars. Results: We
obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper
limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the
rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the
subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants
spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the
stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep
discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better
than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found
to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the
location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that
contract from those that expand. Conclusions: We characterized
the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of
metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main
sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of
angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp
gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it
is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes
that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant
branches.

	abstract = {Context. While rotation has a major impact on stellar structure and 
evolution, its effects are not well understood. Thanks to high-quality
and long-time base photometric observations obtained with recent space
missions, we are now able to study stellar rotation more precisely. Aims: We aim to constrain radial differential rotation profiles in
γ Doradus (γ Dor) stars, and to develop new theoretical
seismic diagnosis for such stars with rapid and potentially non-uniform
rotation. Methods: We have derived a new asymptotic description
which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core rotation on
gravity-mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are
illustrated from pulsation computations with the code {GYRE} and compared
with observations of γ Dor stars. When possible, we also derived
the surface rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing
signatures of rotational modulation, and computed the core-to-surface
rotation ratios. Results: Stellar rotation must be strongly
differential before its effects on period spacing patterns can be
detected, unless multiple period spacing patterns can be compared. Six
stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained period spacing pattern
of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai modes. Finally,
we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the photometric data
of eight targets. Conclusions: If only one period spacing pattern
is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect
differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the
best solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple
period spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface
rotation rate is known as well. This is the case for eight of the stars
in our sample, revealing surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95

	abstract = {I argue that the rotation of white dwarfs is not a remnant of the angular momentum of their main sequence progenitors but a result of the mass loss process on the {AGB}. Weak magnetic fields, if present in stellar interiors, are likely to maintain approximately uniform rotation in stars, both on the main sequence and on the giant branches. The nearly uniform rotation of the core of the Sun is evidence for the existence of such fields. Exactly axisymmetric mass loss on the {AGB} from uniformly rotating stars would lead lead to white dwarfs with very long rotation periods ({\textgreater} 10 yr). Small random non-axisymmetries ( {\textasciitilde} 10(-3) ) in the mass loss process, on the other hand, add sufficient angular momentum to explain the observed rotation periods around one day. The process illustrated with a computation of the probability distribution of the rotation periods under the combined influence of random forcing by weak nonaxisymmetries and angular momentum loss in the {AGB} superwind. Such asymmetries can in principle be observed by proper motion studies of the clumps in interferometric images of {SiO} maser emission.},

The average space velocity of their progenitor stars is less than 15kms-1, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial `kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth
characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1,000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. The specific physical process that `kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, but unless its force is exerted exactly head-on it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks may cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2s, and never become radio pulsars.},

The meridian flow is calculated and the partial differential equation which governs the transport of angular momentum is derived. Both the meridian circulation and the turbulence are determined by the loss of angular momentum, which is ascribed solely to a stellar wind. When there is no wind, the meridian flow is very weak, and it can even vanish in slow rotators. When the wind is active, it drives the circulation in order to transport angular momentum to the surface, but the advection of chemical species by this flow is partly inhibited because of the horizontal turbulence. It is concluded that, since the old population {II} stars are slow rotators, they do not display at their surface the original abundance of lithium.},

with realistic time-dependent redistribution of angular momentum and
chemical composition due to gas-dynamical instabilities. Convection and
Eddington circulation are found to be the most important mechanisms for
changing the angular-momentum distribution, while the dynamical shear
and Solberg-Hoiland instabilities produce chemical mixing in regions
which remain unmixed in nonrotating calculations. The calculations
indicate that ignoring the finite time scales associated with
angular-momentum redistribution is a poor and often misleading
approximation. The primary results are: (1) evolved stellar cores
develop nonaxisymmetric instabilities corresponding to the bifurcation
of the Maclaurin sequence before they reach critical (Keplerian)
rotational velocities; (2) for the 7-solar-mass star, the instability
point is reached prior to carbon ignition, indicating that catastrophic
carbon detonation may be avoided by rotating stars; and (3) the
hydrodynamic events associated with violent stellar death will generally
involve rapidly rotating, triaxial, or fissioning cores. In addition to
radically altering the nature of these events, this indicates that
stellar collapse may be a strong source of gravitational-wave radiation.},

equatorial rotational velocity of 210 km/s. On the main sequence, the
effects of rotation are of minor importance. However, as the core
contracts during later stages, important effects arise in all physically
plausible cases. The outer regions of the cores approach critical
velocities and develop unstable angular-velocity distributions. The
effects of these instabilities should significantly alter the subsequent

However, observations reveal that about 1\% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the big bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2330 low-mass (1–3 M ⊙) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning cores (), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations for the origin of lithium-rich giants. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a binary companion.},

	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We suggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper mixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars, the Li-rich phase occurs on the early-{AGB}. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present two new results. The first concerns the proper identification of the critical Richardson number Ri(cr) above which there is no longer turbulent mixing. Thus far, all studies have assumed that: Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) = 1/4. However, since
Riell(cr) determines the upper limit of a laminar regime (superscript l), it has little relevance to stars where the problem is not to determine the end point of a laminar regime but the endpoint of turbulence. We show that the latter is characterized by Rit (cr), where t stands for turbulence, and has a value four times larger than (1): Ri (cr) = Rit (cr) ≈ 4 Riell (cr)≈ 1. We also show that use of (2) instead of (1) changes the conclusions of recent studies. Inclusion of radiative losses (characterized by the Peclet number Pe) which weaken stable stratification and help
turbulence, further changes (2) to (r stands for radiative): Ri (cr) = Rir (cr) {\textasciitilde} (1+Pe)Pe-1 Rit (cr) which, for Pe{\textless}1, allows turbulence to survive far longer than (2). Finally, turbulent convection generates gravity waves that propagate into the radiative region and act as an additional source of energy. This further changes Eq. (3) to (gw stands for gravity waves): Ri (cr) =
Rigw (cr) =Rir (1+ηgw) where
etagw {\textgreater}1. In conclusion, the successive inclusion of
relevant physical processes leads to a chain of increasing values of Ri (cr): Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) → Rit (cr)→
Ri{\textasciicircum}r (cr)→ Rigw (cr). The second result concerns the
dependence of the diffusivity D on Omega . We show that the commonly used expression Dχ-1{\textasciitilde} (Ω/N)2
is not correct for the regime Pe{\textless}1 that characterizes a stably
stratified regime. The proper Omega -dependence is:
Dχ-1{\textasciitilde} (Ω/N)4.},

A dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. It produces a
predominantly horizontal field. This dynamo process is found to be more effective in transporting angular momentum than the known hydrodynamic mechanisms. It might account for the observed pattern of rotation in the solar core.},

assumptions are considerably less restrictive than those of previous
analyses. The angular velocity need not have cylindrical isorotational
surfaces, and a priori convective stability is not assumed. In an
unmagnetized gas, stability under these circumstances would be governed
by the Høland criteria. These criteria change qualitatively when
even a weak magnetic field is present. In a magnetized plasma, the new
criteria for stability have the same general form exhibited by the
purely hydrodynamical case, but with all angular momentum gradients
replaced by angular velocity gradients. Our findings are in accord with
those of Papaloizou \& Szuszkiewicz, who, using very different
methods, considered the stability of isorotational field configurations.
The results presented here thus point very generally to angular velocity
gradients, not angular momentum gradients, as the fundamental stability
discriminants in rotating astrophysical plasmas.},

Aims: We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the
numerical configuration and Reynolds number of the flow. Methods:
We compare results from simulations performed with two different
numerical codes, including one that uses the shearing-box formalism. We
also extensively study the dependence of the turbulent diffusion
coefficient on the turbulent Reynolds number. Results: The two
numerical codes used in this study give consistent results. The
turbulent diffusion coefficient is independent of the size of the
numerical domain if at least three large turbulent structures fit in the
box. Generally, the turbulent diffusion coefficient depends on the
turbulent Reynolds number. However, our simulations suggest that an
asymptotic regime is obtained when the turbulent Reynolds number is
larger than 103. Conclusions: Shear mixing in the
regime of small Péclet numbers can be investigated numerically
both with shearing-box simulations and simulations using explicit
forcing. Our results suggest that Zahn's model is valid at large
turbulent Reynolds numbers.},

	url = {http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2000A%26A...361..101M},
	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 
120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of
rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for
non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with
rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal
turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects,
advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the
non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements.
Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an
importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional
circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in
1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then
slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main
cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and
goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is
the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in
depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary
approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would
be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction
and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum.
The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the
most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a
lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the
velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities.
However, stars with masses below {\textasciitilde} 12 Msun with initially
high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of
the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other
interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For
an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a
moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may
increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase
the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the
isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about
25\% in general. However, for stars with M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 40 Msun and
fast rotation, a bluewards ``homogeneous-like'' track, with important
He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates
for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in
the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff,
differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what
still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings
significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher
masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast
rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account
for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low
rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{He20\}). These stars
likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and
lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison
of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion
by Venn ({\textbackslash}cite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}cite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly
result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with
the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}cite\{Lyu96\}).},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in constant rotation surfaces, the isorotational contours of the solar convective zone may be reproduced with great fidelity. Even at this early stage of development, this helioseismology fit may be used to put a lower bound on the mid-latitude radial solar entropy gradient, which is in good accord with standard mixing length theory. In this paper, we generalize this solar calculation to fully convective stars (and potentially planets), retaining the assumptions of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in isorotational surfaces. It is found that each isorotation contour is of the form R2 = A + {BΦ}(r), where R is the radius from the rotation axis, Φ(r) is the (assumed spherical) gravitational potential, and A and B are constants along the contour. This result is applied to simple models of fully convective stars. Both solar-like surface rotation profiles (angular velocity decreasing toward the poles) as well as `antisolar' profiles (angular velocity increasing toward the poles) are modelled; the latter bear some suggestive resemblance to numerical simulations. We also perform exploratory studies of zonal surface flows similar to those seen in Jupiter and Saturn. In addition to providing a practical framework for understanding the results of large-scale numerical simulations, our findings may also prove useful in dynamical calculations for which a simple but viable model for the background rotation profile in a convecting fluid is needed. Finally, our work bears directly on an important goal of the {CoRoT} programme: to elucidate the internal structure of rotating, convecting stars.},

	abstract = {Current practices in stellar evolution employ one dimensional calculations that quantitatively apply only to a minority of the observed stars (single non-rotating stars, or well detached binaries). Even in these systems, astrophysicists are dependent on approximations to handle complex three dimensional (3D) processes like convection. Understanding the structure of binary stars, like those that lead to the Type{\textasciitilde}Ia supernovae used to measure the expansion of the universe, are grossly non-spherical and await a 3D treatment.

To approach very large problems like multi dimensional modeling of stars, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has invested in massively parallel computers and invested even more in developing the algorithms to utilize them on complex physics problems.  We have leveraged skills from across the lab to develop a 3D stellar evolution code, Djehuty (after the Egyptian god for writing and calculation) that operates efficiently on platforms with thousands of nodes, with the best available physical data (Opacities, {EOS}, etc.). Djehuty has incorporated all basic physics for modeling stars including an accurate equation of state, radiation transport by diffusion, thermonuclear reaction rates, and hydrodynamics, and have begun testing it in a number of
applications.},

calculations is assumed to be a gravitational point source. These calculations are performed from the {ZAMS} to very close to when mass transfer would begin. We find that the interior properties of the models, such as the time history of the central temperature, central density, and convective core mass are essentially unchanged in the 2-D models from the 1- D results. This is true even though the convective core is not quite spherically symmetric, but slightly elongated in the direction of the companion. We treat the 2-D model surface as an equipotential. The surface matches that of a Roche potential closely until the elongation toward the companion is close to that required for mass transfer. Moreover, the surface evolution as Roche lobe overflow is approached becomes so rapid that the surface may not be able to adjust sufficiently fast to remain an equipotential. We conclude the 1-D approach is satisfactory through the events covered by our calculations except possibly just before mass transfer begins.},

In addition to all aspects of single-star evolution, features such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope evolution, collisions, supernova kicks and angular momentum loss mechanisms are included. In particular, circularization and synchronization of the orbit by tidal interactions are calculated for convective, radiative and degenerate damping mechanisms. We use this algorithm to study the formation and evolution of various binary systems. We also investigate the effect that tidal friction has on the outcome of binary evolution. Using the rapid binary code, we generate a series of large binary populations and evaluate the formation rate of interesting individual species and events. By comparing the results for populations with and without tidal friction, we quantify the hitherto ignored systematic effect of tides and show that modelling of tidal evolution in binary systems is necessary in order to draw accurate conclusions from population synthesis work. Tidal synchronism is important but, because orbits generally circularize before Roche lobe overflow, the outcome of the interactions of systems with the same semilatus rectum is almost independent of eccentricity. It is not necessary to include a distribution of eccentricities in population synthesis of interacting binaries; however, the initial separations should be distributed according to the observed distribution of
semilatera recta rather than periods or semimajor axes.},

combined action of the thermally driven meridional circulation and of
the turbulence generated by the shear of differential rotation. The
turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, due to the stratification, with
stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical.
The main difference with the former treatments by Zahn ({\textbackslash}cite\{Zahn1992\},
A\&A, 265, 115) and Maeder \& Zahn ({\textbackslash}cite\{Maeder1998\}, A\&A,
334, 1000) is that we expand here the departures from spherical symmetry
to higher order, and include explicitly the differential rotation in
latitude, to first order. This allows us to treat simultaneously the
bulk of a radiation zone and its tachocline(s). Moreover, we take fully
into account the non-stationarity of the problem, which will enable us
to tackle the rapid phases of evolution. The system of partial
differential equations, which govern the transport of angular momentum,
heat and chemical elements, is written in a form which makes it ready to
implement in a stellar evolution code. Here the effect of a magnetic
field is deliberately ignored; it will be included in forthcoming
papers.

	abstract = {Context. Rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, 
with far-reaching consequences for stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis,
and stellar explosions. Aims: Nitrogen surface abundances for a
large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud ({LMC}) have recently been obtained by the {ESO} {VLT}-{FLAMES}
Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first to cover a broad range
of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough sample
of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis.
Here we use the sample to provide the first rigorous and quantitative
test of the theory of rotational mixing in massive stars. 
Methods: We calculated a grid of stellar evolution models, using the
{VLT}-{FLAMES} sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing processes.
We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid to
simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages, and rotational
velocity distributions consistent with those from the {VLT}-{FLAMES} sample.
The synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in
the observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical
results and theoretical predictions. Results: Our simulations
reproduce the fraction of stars without significant nitrogen enrichment.
However, the predicted number of rapid rotators with enhanced nitrogen
is about twice as large as found observationally. Furthermore, two
groups of stars (one consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched
objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects)
cannot be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. 
Conclusions: Physical processes in addition to rotational mixing appear
to be required to understand the population of massive main-sequence
stars from the {VLT}-{FLAMES} sample. We discuss the possible role of binary
stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find
that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is
unlikely to be produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down
in close binary systems. A conclusive assessment of the role of
rotational mixing in massive stars requires a quantitative analysis that
also accounts for the effects of binarity and magnetic fields.},

We briefly review the results of observational studies of solar-type stars seeking to evaluate the linkage between rotation rate and possible magnetic cycles of activity. Clearly turbulent convection and rotation within spherical shell geometries provide ingredients essential for dynamo action. However, intensive efforts over several decades in solar research have demonstrated that it is no easy matter to achieve cyclic magnetic activity that is in accord with observations. Helioseismology has revealed that an essential element for the global solar dynamo is the presence of a tachocline of shear at the base of the solar
convection zone, leading to the likely operation of an interface dynamo. We review the crucial elements for achieving a cyclic magnetic activity. We then discuss some of our current 3 D {MHD} simulations of solar turbulent convection in spherical shells that yield differential rotation profiles which make good contact with some of the helioseismic findings. We show that such turbulent motions can amplify and sustain magnetic field in the bulk of the convective zone whose strength are sufficient to feed back both upon the convection and its global
circulations.},

five masses between 3 and 20 Msolar. The sequence of models
for each mass might be regarded as having one small, one moderate, and
two fairly rapid rotations. The convective core rotation law and
overshooting are determined by two-dimensional, fully implicit
hydrodynamic calculations. All models exhibit convective core
overshooting. The slowly rotating models show primarily radial
convective motion, while the instantaneous flow patterns of the more
rapidly rotating models show that the motion is primarily parallel to
the rotation axis. The resulting core rotation rate may be fitted by a
power law in the distance from the rotation axis, with a cutoff at small
distances from the axis, at least for the moderately and rapidly
rotating models. The rotation law in the radiative region external to
the convective core was chosen to be uniform for the first models
calculated, but some models with negative power laws were constructed.
These showed that the power law could not be too steep, or the model
developed a density inversion near the rotation axis because the
pressure gradient must essentially balance the rotational variation,
since the gradient of the gravitational potential is too shallow to aid
significantly in the balance.},

luminosity are included in stellar structure equations. Results: The equilibrium structure of rotationally and tidally distorted star is exactly a triaxial ellipsoids. A formula describing the isobars is presented, and the rotational velocity and the gravitational
acceleration at the primary surface simulated. The results show the distortion at the outer layers of the primary increases with temporal variation and system evolution. Besides, it was observed that the luminosity accretion is unstable, and the curve of the energy-generation rate fluctuates after the main sequence in rotation sequences. The luminosity in rotation sequences is slightly weaker than that in non-rotation sequences. As a result, the volume expands slowly. Polar ejection is intensified by the tidal effect. The ejection of an
equatorial ring may be favoured by both the opacity effect and the g\_e(θ,{\textbackslash}varphi)-effect in the binary system.},

	abstract = {We discuss the first available binary evolution models which include up-to-date rotational physics for both components, as well as angular momentum accretion and spin-orbit coupling. These models allow a self-consistent computation of the mass transfer efficiency during Roche-lobe overflow phases, and a determination of the transition from quasi-conservative to non-conservative evolution. Applications to massive binary systems lead to predictions for the spin rates of compact objects in binaries, and for the occurrence of gamma-ray bursts from collapsars in binaries. Rotational effects in accreting white dwarfs are found to stabilise the shell burning and decrease the carbon abundance in progenitor models for Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia supernovae, and to potentially avoid a detonation of the white dwarf within the
sub-Chandrasekhar mass scenario.},

It is shown that the small separation can be affected by rotation at the level of 0.1-0.2 μHz for a 1.4
Msolar model rotating with an equatorial velocity of 20 km/s at the surface. This is of the same order of magnitude as the expected precision on frequencies with a 3 months observation and must therefore be taken into account. We show however that it is possible to recover the small separation free of these contaminating effects of rotation, provided enough high quality data are available as will be with space seismic missions such as Eddington.},

	abstract = {Models of stellar evolution with rotation are very much needed in order 
to interpret recent stellar properties, in particular for massive stars.
For that we proceed to a detailed investigation of some critical
physical processes in rotating stars: 1. The equation expressing the
transport of angular momentum by circulation and diffusion is revised to
also account for expansion and contraction in non-stationary models. 2.
We examine the current expressions for the velocity U(r) of the
meridional circulation, also taking into account mu -gradients and
horizontal turbulence. We show that there are no ``mu -currents'' but
just meridional currents which can be sizeably influenced by the
gradients of mean molecular weight mu . A proper account of the mu
-gradients may reduce U(r) by one or two orders of magnitude with
respect to current expressions. 3. While the usual expressions for the
meridional circulation would predict an infinite velocity at the edge of
a radiative and semiconvective zone and an inverted circulation in a
semiconvective zone, the present developments give a continuity of the
solutions for the circulation. 4. The approximation of a stationary
circulation, which is no longer valid after the main-sequence phase, is
also removed and the case of a general equation of state is considered.
We notice that in the stationary regime the horizontal fluctuations of
mu represent some fixed fraction of the vertical mu -gradient. To first
order, this fraction is not dependent on rotation, because the building
of horizontal fluctuations by the circulation is compensated by the
smoothing due to horizontal turbulence.},

The observed wind terminal velocities are used with the analytic approximation for the theory of radiatively driven winds (Kudritzki et al., 1989) to obtain masses and mass loss rates. The masses derived from the spectroscopic analysis and those derived independently from the wind theory agree, except for a small difference attributed to deficiencies in the physics of the model atmospheres used. A comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that (1) evolution theory cannot explain the observed helium abundance pattern and that (2) the masses derived from the spectroscopic analysis (or the wind theory) are systematically lower than those derived from evolutionary calculations.},

Effective temperatures and gravities for these stars are derived. Projected rotational velocities are measured using a cross-correlation technique. Abundances are derived using {LTE} methods and non-{LTE} equivalent width calculations. He, C, N, and O abundances of the nonsupergiant stars in the sample are found to be very close to the values found for the Orion Nebula, with the notable exception of a few stars which show enhanced N, a signature of {CN}-cycled material.

This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient {GCs}, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the {GC} population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

its way to becoming a supernova, a complex, differentially rotating
structure is set up. Angular momentum is transported by a variety of
classic instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields generated
by the differential rotation. We present the first stellar evolution
calculations to follow the evolution of rotating massive stars
including, at least approximately, all these effects, magnetic and
nonmagnetic, from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of
iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the magnetic fields is
as described by Spruit in 2002, and a range of uncertain parameters is
explored. In general, we find that magnetic torques decrease the final
rotation rate of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50
when compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular momentum in
that part of the presupernova star destined to become a neutron star is
an increasing function of main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived
from more massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more
important role in the star's explosion. The final angular momentum of
the core has been determined-to within a factor of 2-by the time the
star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter stars studied, around 15
Msolar, we predict pulsar periods at birth near 15 ms, though
a factor of 2 range is easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several
mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially by
fallback, are explored.},

There is currently little consensus on the most appropriate 1D models of semi-convection and overshooting convection, so we have implemented the
physically-motivated semi-convection prescriptions from Wood, Garaud, \& Stellmach (2013) and Moll, Garaud, \& Stellmach (in

	shorttitle = {Stellar evolution with rotation {IV}},
	abstract = {The von Zeipel theorem is generalised to account for differential 
rotation in the case of a ``shellular'' rotation law (cf. Zahn 1992). We
write this law in the form Omega = Omega (r), a simplification which
does not apply to fast rotation. We find that von Zeipel's relation
contains a small additional term, generally further increasing the
radiative flux at the pole and decreasing it at the equator. We also
examine the local Eddington factor in rotating stars and notice some
significant differences with respect to current expressions. We examine
the latitudinal dependence of the mass loss rates dot \{M\} (vartheta ) in
rotating stars and find two main source of wind anisotropies: 1) the
``geff'' effect which enhances the polar ejection; 2) the
``opacity effect'' (or ``kappa -effect''), which favours equatorial
ejection. In O-stars the geff effect is expected to largely
dominate. In B- and later type stars the opacity effect should favour
equatorial ejection and the formation of equatorial rings. We also
examine the behaviour of the wind density and notice a strong
enhancement at the equator of B- and later type stars. Possible
relations with the polar ejections and the skirt of eta Carinae and with
the inner and outer rings of {SN} 1987 A are mentioned. If dot \{M\}
(vartheta ) has sharp extrema due to some peaks in the opacity law, non
equatorial and symmetrical rings may be produced. We also show that the
global mass loss rate of a star at a given location in the {HR} diagram is
rapidly increasing with rotation, which is in good agreement with the
numerical models by Friend \& Abbott (1986). Anisotropic stellar
winds remove selectively the angular momentum. For example, winds
passing through polar caps in O-stars remove very little angular
momentum, an excess of angular momentum is thus retained and rapidly
redistributed by horizontal turbulence. These excesses may lead some
Wolf-Rayet stars, those resulting directly from O-stars, to be fast
spinning objects, while we predict that the {WR}-stars which have passed
through the red supergiant phase will have lower rotation velocities on
the average. We also show how anisotropic ejection can be treated in
numerical models by properly modifying the outer boundary conditions for
the transport of angular momentum. Finally, in an Appendix the equation
of the surface for stars with shellular rotation is discussed.},

We find that the resonances of the free gravity modes are damped by radiative dissipation, which operates in a relatively thin region below the surface of the star. Due to that dissipation, some properties of the dynamical tide have observable consequences in close binary systems: (1) A torque is applied to a binary component; this serves to make it corotate with its companion in a time which can be short compared to its nuclear life.

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of 
massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \& Thomas (1970) to
incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional
stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular
velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how
this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular
velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn
1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the
stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with
the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating
stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains
constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments
brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and
Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability
are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses
of 9, 20, 40 and 60Msun\_ with account of the above
hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones:
1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial
angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface
critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models
(40 to 60Msun\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary
tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the
ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to
2.5Msun\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the
μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit
mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to
overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing
in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that
different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched
for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et
al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational
velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify
the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence
lifetime.},

investigate the alignment of protostellar spin and molecular outflows for forming binary pairs. We show that the protostellar pairs, which form from turbulent fragmentation within a single parent core, have randomly oriented angular momentum. Although the pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially misaligned. We produce 12CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations and characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The
{CO}-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also statistically consistent with the observed distribution of
molecular outflows. We conclude that the observed misalignment provides a clear signature of binary formation via turbulent fragmentation. The persistence of misaligned outflows and stellar spins following dynamical evolution may provide a signature of binary origins for more evolved multiple star systems.},

	abstract = {With observations of the {EP} Cru system, we continue our series of 
measurements of spin-orbit angles in eclipsing binary star systems, the
{BANANA} project (Binaries Are Not Always Neatly Aligned). We find a close
alignment between the sky projections of the rotational and orbital
angular momentum vectors for both stars (βp =
-1.°8 ± 1.°6 and {\textbar}βs{\textbar} {\textless}
17°). We also derive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages
for this system. The {EP} Cru and {DI} Her systems provide an interesting
comparison: they have similar stellar types and orbital properties, but
{DI} Her is younger and has major spin-orbit misalignments, raising the
question of whether {EP} Cru also had a large misalignment at an earlier
phase of evolution. We show that tidal dissipation is an unlikely
explanation for the good alignment observed today, because realignment
happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, and the
stars in {EP} Cru are far from synchronization (they are spinning nine
times too quickly). Therefore it seems that some binaries form with
aligned axes, while other superficially similar binaries are formed with
misaligned axes.

young early-type stars ({\textasciitilde}6 Myr, B0.5V+B2V), in an eccentric and
relatively long-period orbit (e = 0.48, P = 15fd3). The sky projections
of the rotation vector and the spin vector are well aligned
(βp = 2° ± 4°), in strong contrast to {DI}
Her. Although no convincing explanation has yet been given for the
misalignment of {DI} Her, our results show that the phenomenon is not
universal, and that a successful theory will need to account for the
different outcome in the case of {NY} Cep.

The observed precession rate is a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that once was interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity. Among the contemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet and a large tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit. Here we report that both stars of {DI} Herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicular to the orbital axis (contrary to the usual assumption for close binary stars). The rotationally induced stellar oblateness causes precession in the direction opposite to that of relativistic precession, thereby
reconciling the theoretical and observed rates.},

A dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. It produces a
predominantly horizontal field. This dynamo process is found to be more effective in transporting angular momentum than the known hydrodynamic mechanisms. It might account for the observed pattern of rotation in the solar core.},

Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core. Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime, which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than 300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex. No satisfactory theoretical explanation currently exists for our observations.},

The resulting formulae are used to estimate the equilibrium energies and quality factors of the acoustic modes in a box which contains turbulent fluid. The scattering of acoustic radiation by the turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations is treated and the rate at which nonlinear interactions transfer energy among the acoustic modes is evaluated.

	abstract = {The {GONG} and {MDI} global helioseismology pipelines provide solar acoustic 
mode parameters for 108- and 72-day time series respectively by fitting
the 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m spectra of a given (n, ℓ/) multiplet
either individually ({GONG}) or simultaneously ({MDI}). Our knowledge of the
variable solar interior through helioseismic observations derives
primarily from these two analysis pipelines. We have developed a new
method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting the rotation- and
structure-induced frequency shift for each m-spectrum to minimize the
mode width in the m-averaged spectrum. The m-averaged spectrum appears
to be a powerful tool for low signal-to-noise-ratio modes in the
low-frequency range where the modes have very long lifetimes. Indeed, in
the case of spatially-resolved helioseismic data ({MDI}, {GONG}, {HMI}), for a
given multiplet (n, ℓ/), there exist 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m
spectra, which can result in an average spectrum with a {SNR} ≫ 1 even
when the individual-m spectra have a {SNR} {\textless} 1. We show here that the
m-averaged spectrum technique, applied to the {GONG} 108-day and {MDI}
72-day time series, gives us access to a whole new range of predicted,
low-{SNR} modes that had not been successfully fitted by the current {MDI}
and {GONG} peak-fitting pipelines. We show that the modes that are
measured by both techniques are extracted without bias. We apply this
technique to 360-, 720-, 1080-, and 1440-day long {GONG} time series to
infer the variability of the mode parameters with solar activity in the
low-frequency range below {\textasciitilde} 1500 μHz.},

be within the design specification, for the entire instrument as well as
for the separate sub-systems. Malfunctioning of the polarising
mechanisms after 3 to 4 months operation has led to the adoption of an
unplanned operating sequence in which these mechanisms are no longer
used. This mode, which measures only the blue wing of the solar sodium
lines, detracts little from the detection and frequency measurements of
global oscillations, but does make more difficult the absolute velocity
calibration, which is currently of the order of 20\%. Data continuity in
the new mode is extremely high and the instrument is producing
exceptionally noise-free p-mode spectra. The data set is particularly
well suited to the study of effects due to the excitation mechanism of
the modes, leading to temporal variations in their amplitudes. The g
modes have not yet been detected in this limited data set. In the
present mode of operation, there are no indications of any degradation
which would limit the use of {GOLF} for up to 6 years or more.},

	abstract = {The Solar Oscillations Investigation ({SOI}) uses the Michelson Doppler Imager ({MDI}) instrument to probe the interior of the Sun by measuring the photospheric manifestations of solar oscillations. Characteristics of the modes reveal the static and dynamic properties of the convection zone and core. Knowledge of these properties will improve our
understanding of the solar cycle and of stellar evolution. Other photospheric observations will contribute to our knowledge of the solar magnetic field and surface motions. The investigation consists of coordinated efforts by several teams pursuing specific scientific objectives. The instrument images the Sun on a 10242 {CCD} camera through a series of increasingly narrow spectral filters. The final elements, a pair of tunable Michelson interferometers, enable {MDI} to record filtergrams with a {FWHM} bandwidth of 94 {mÅ}. Normally 20 images centered at 5 wavelengths near the Ni I 6768 spectral line are recorded each minute. {MDI} calculates velocity and continuum intensity from the filtergrams with a resolution of 4″ over the whole disk. An extensive calibration program has verified the end-to-end performance of the instrument. To provide continuous observations of the
longest-lived modes that reveal the internal structure of the Sun, a carefully-selected set of spatial averages are computed and downlinked at all times. About half the time {MDI} will also be able to downlink complete velocity and intensity images each minute. This high rate telemetry ({HRT}) coverage is available for at least a continuous 60-day interval each year and for 8 hours each day during the rest of the year. During the 8-hour {HRT} intervals, 10 of the exposures each minute can be programmed for other observations, such as measurements in {MDI}'s higher resolution (1.25″) field centered about 160″ north of the
equator; meanwhile, the continuous structure program proceeds during the other half minute. Several times each day, polarizers will be inserted to measure the line-of-sight magnetic field. {MDI} operations will be scheduled well in advance and will vary only during the daily 8-hour campaigns. Quick-look and summary data, including magnetograms, will be processed immediately. Most high-rate data will be delivered only by mail to the {SOI} Science Support Center ({SSSC}) at Stanford, where a processing pipeline will produce 3 Terabytes of calibrated data products each year. These data products will be analyzed using the {SSSC} and the distributed resources of the co-investigators. The data will be
available for collaborative investigations.},

	abstract = {{SOHO} will carry twelve sophisticated telescopes and other instruments, developed in record time by twelve international consortia involving scientific institutes in 15 countries. Roger M. Bonnet, the Director of {ESA}’s Scientific Programme said: "Each one of these instruments by itself would be enough to make major breakthroughs in our understanding of the Sun. But what makes {SOHO} such an exciting mission is that we will operate all the instruments together and find possible links between various phenomena at different levels in the volume of the Sun and in the interplanetary medium". Four years of intense efforts by space engineering teams in {ESA} and across Europe, under the leadership of the prime contractor Matra Marconi Space of Toulouse, France, have fulflled the dream of scientists who wished to build a superb space observatory for examining the Sun. {SOHO}, together with the four-spacecraft Cluster mission - which will explore near-Earth space, forms the
Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme, the first cornerstone in
{ESA}’s long-term programme 'Horizon 2000'.

No night time for {SOHO}

Instead of being placed in orbit around the Earth, {SOHO} will be lofted to a position where the gravitational pulls of the Earth and the Sun cancel each other out exactly, at 1.5 million kilometres sunward from the Earth. This is known in astronomy as the inner Lagrangian point after the French mathematician, Joseph Louis Lagrange, who first calculated its position near the end of the eighteenth century.

{SOHO} will fly in an elliptical, or "halo" orbit around the Lagrangian point, with an orbit radius of about 600,000 kilometres, allowing the spacecraft to experience perpetual day. It will have a continuous, uninterrupted view of the Sun for twenty four hours of the day, all three hundred and sixty five days of the year, producing an
extraordinary amount of data.

All previous solar observatories have either been on the Earth or in orbit around our planet. On the Earth, telescopes are limited by inclement weather conditions and atmospheric distortion of the
Sun’s signal, and of course they cannot observe the Sun at night. Although the weather problem has been removed in orbit around the Earth, observations are still periodically interrupted when an Earth-orbiting spacecraft enters our planet’s shadow. In contrast, {SOHO} will
provide the first long, clean uninterrupted views of the Sun.

Science Objectives

{SOHO} will look beyond the visible soar disk, observing through new windows from the centre of the Sun to the Earth. It will examine three regions - the hidden interior of the Sun, the hot transparent
solar atmosphere, and the eternal solar wind of charged particles and magnetic fields that continuously flow outward from the Sun. The twelve instruments on board {SOHO} are designed to study one or two of these regions in a different, yet complimentary way. Their combined data will link events in the Sun’s atmosphere and solar wind changes taking place deep within the Sun.

The {SOHO} mission has three principle scientific objectives:

1. Study of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior

2. Study of the heating mechanisms of the Sun's million-degree
atmosphere, or solar corona

3. Investigation of the solar wind, its origin and its acceleration processes.

"Never before have solar physicists had the opportunity to work with such a comprehensive observatory giving them access literally to the whole Sun", said Martin C. E. Huber, the Head of {ESA}'s Space Science Department.

Taking the pulse of the Sun

{SOHO} wil illuminate the unseen depths of the Sun by recording widespread throbbing motions of the Sun's visible "surface", or photosphere. These oscillations are caused by sounds that are trapped inside the Sun. On striking the surface and rebounding back down, the sound waves cause the gases there to move up and down.

Sound waves that penetrate deep within the Sun produce global surface oscillations with longer periods of up to a few hours; smaller, shorter oscillations refer to shallower layers. By considering a sequence of oscillations with longer and longer periods, describing sound waves that penetrate deeper and deeper, {SOHO} will 'peel away' progressively distant layers of the Sun and establish physical properties inside the Sun's deep interior. Since the technique is similar in scientific principle to using earthquakes, or seismic waves, to decipher the Earth's internal structure, it has become known as helioseismology.

{SOHO}'s helioseismology data may shed light on solar neutrinos; they are insubstantial, subatomic particles created in prodigious quantities inside the Sun's energy-generating core. Neutrinos move at the velocity of light and travel almost unimpeded through the Sun, the Earth and nearly any amount of matter. The difficulty is that underground
detectors always observe fewer neutrinos than theory says they should detect, a discrepancy known as the solar neutrino problem. Either the Sun does not shine the way we think it ought to, or our basic
understanding of neutrinos is in error.

{SOHO}'s record of surface oscillations may establish the temperature at the centre of the Sun, and tell us if there is something wrong with our knowledge of the way stars shine. If the centre of the Sun is about a million degrees cooler than is presently thought, nuclear reactions would produce fewer neutrinos and resolve the solar neutrino problem. But if the internal temperature has the expected value, then the neutrinos may have an identity crisis, undergoing metamorphosis before reaching terrestrial detectors that therefore cannot see them.

Future {SOHO} helioseismology observations will also improve our
understanding of the solar dynamo responsible for the Sun's magnetic field. The dynamo is located somewhere in the solar interior where the hot, rotating material generates electrical currents and converts the energy of motion into magnetic energy. Magnetic fields, spawned by the dynamo inside the Sun, thread their way out into the solar atmosphere where they mould the electrified gas into an ever-changing shape. The entire atmosphere is continuously transformed by the Sun's varying magnetism, producing activity on a scale unknown on Earth.

Looking inside the Sun

There are three helioseismology experts on board {SOHO} that will acquire long uninterrupted observations of solar oscillations. Two of them emphasise global, long-period oscillations and sound waves that can penetrate the deep solar interior. They are known as {GOLF}, for Global Oscillations at Low Frequency, and {VIRGO}, an acronym for Variability of solar {IRradiance} and Gravity Oscillations. The third {SOHO}
helioseismology instrument will obtain data for oscillations on smaller spatial scales with unprecedented precision; it is called the Solar Oscillations Investigation/Michelson Doppler Imager, or {SOI}/{MDI} for short.

{GOLF} and {MDI} employ the familiar Doppler technique for measuring motions of the solar photosphere. When part of the visible surface heaves up towards us, the wavelength of a spectral line formed in that region is shortened; if the region moves away from us, back toward the solar interior, the wavelength is lengthened. (A spectral line absorbed or emitted by an atom or an ion at a specific wavelength that identifies the element; it looks like a line in a spectral display of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength).

Sound waves can also be used to determine the internal rotation of the Sun. Waves propagating in the direction of rotation will appear, to a fixed observer, to move faster and their measure speeds will be shorter. Waves propagating against the rotation will be slowed down with longer periods. Accurate measurements of this oscillation period splitting will determine rotation within the solar interior.

{GOLF} aims to measure velocities as low as 1 millimetre per second for global surface oscillations with periods from 3 minutes to 100 days. {SOI}/{MDI} will obtain precise oscillation data with high spatial
resolution, investigating surface oscillations of relatively small spatial scales and short periods. Both instruments will determine the radial distribution of density, pressure and temperature, establish the depth and latitude variation of rotation, and determine interior conditions that lead to the development of solar magnetic activity.

{VIRGO} will measure variations in the Sun's irradiance, or its total luminous output, with extremely accurate, precise and stable
radiometers. As the Sun fades and brightens, {VIRGO} will obtain a sensitive record of global, long-period oscillations, refining our knowledge of the physical and dynamic properties of the deep solar interior.

The precise, long-duration measurements from {GOLF} and {VIRGO} may also lead to the unambiguous detection of solar waves for the first time. They are largely confined to the Sun's energy-generating core, and the force of gravity determines how quickly they rise and fall, much like waves in the ocean. Gravity waves that manage to reach the visible solar surface are expected to have long periods of an hour or more and to reveal conditions at the very centre of the Sun. They will shed new light on the solar neutrino problem and determine if the Sun's rotation speed increase near its centre.

The Solar Atmosphere

The entire Sun is just a huge, gaseous sphere that is compressed at its centre and becomes tenuous further out. So, the sharp visible edge of the Sun is an illusion. It is enveloped by gases that are so rarefied that we can see right through them, just as we see through the Earth's transparent air. This tenuous outer part of the Sun is therefore called the solar atmosphere.

The lowest, densest level of the Sun's atmosphere is the photosphere, which simply means the sphere from which visible light comes - from the Greek photos for light. Just above the photosphere lies a thin layer called the chromosphere, from chromos, the Greek work for colour. Still higher, above the chromosphere, is the corona, or crown; this outermost layer of the solar atmosphere extends to the planets and beyond.

The solar corona is extremely hot, with a temperature of a few million degrees. Its very existence is one of the most fundamental, unresolved paradoxes of modern solar physics. The photosphere is closer to the Sun's centre than the corona, but it is several hundred times cooler. Heat should not flow outward from a cooler to a hotter region; it violates common sense and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite more than a half century of investigation, the exact mechanism for heating corona still remains a mystery, and it is one of the main scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission.

Sunlight passes right through the corona without depositing substantial quantities of energy in it. So, radiation cannot resolve the heating problem. Possible mechanisms involve the kinetic energy of moving material and/or magnetic energy. Unlike radiation, both of these forms of energy can flow from cold to hot regions.

In and out motions within the solar interior within the solar interior generate sound waves that could accelerate into supersonic shocks; they apparently dissipate energy and generate heat in the lower chromosphere. However, observations suggest that sound waves cannot significantly heat the corona since they cannot reach that far. {SOHO} will test this conclusion, looking for the varying spectral signatures of sound waves in the chromosphere and corona.

Magnetic energy should play a role in coronal heating. Magnetic fields shape the highly structured corona, and the brightest coronal structures are located where the magnetic field is the strongest. {SOHO}'s spectral instruments will therefore also look for the oscillating intensity and velocity signatures of magnetic waves that are produced by changing magnetism. Magnetic energy can also be converted into heat by numerous small, localised explosive events that have already been observed with space-borne telescopes at ultraviolet wavelengths. {SOHO} will provide new insight to the frequency, locations and power of such explosions.

{SOHO} tunes in the Sun's atmosphere

The solar atmosphere will be studied by five {SOHO} instruments. Three of them will study the chromosphere and the transition region in the low corona. They are known as {SUMER} for Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation, {CDS}, an acronym for Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer, and {EIT}, which is short for Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope. Two {SOHO} instruments will examine the middle corona between 1.1 and 10 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre. They are known as {UVCS} for {UltraViolet} Coronagraph Spectrometer and {LASCO}, an acronym for Large Angle and Spectrometric {COronagraph}.

Four of these instruments detect invisible radiation at ultraviolet ({UV}) or extreme ultraviolet ({EUV}) wavelengths. {UV} light has wavelengths somewhat less that those of visible light, and waves of {EUV} are a little shorter than the {UV} ones. Since this radiation is partially or totally absorbed in our air, it must be observe using telescopes that have been lofted above the Earth's obscuring atmosphere in satellites such as {SOHO}.

We can tune into different parts of the solar atmosphere by isolating {UV} or {EUV} radiation at just one wavelength and forming an image there. Certain {UV} and {EUV} lines act like thermometers, specifying the
temperature when they are formed, while others are sensitive to the local density. Velocities of moving material can also be inferred from wavelength shifts or broadening of the lines. Temperature, density, and velocity measurements from all four experiments will be used to specify heating, flows and wave motions in different magnetic structures and at various levels in the solar atmosphere. When combined, they will uniquely describe an unseen world of violent change, extreme
temperatures and powerful explosion, quite unlike the bland white-light face of the Sun.

{SUMER}, {CDS} and {EIT} will observe lines over a temperature range of 10,000 to a few million degrees, and determine velocities down to 1 kilometre per second. {SUMER} and {CSA} will obtain images of the chromosphere and corona with high spatial and temporal resolution (down to 1 second of arc and as brief as 1 second) with a field view of about 4 minutes of arc; {EIT} will provide full disk images with coarser resolution. {UVCS} is an occulted telescope equipped to measure {UV} line intensities and profiles, determining physical parameters of the solar corona from 1.2 to 10 solar radii from Sun-centre with an angular resolution down to 12 seconds of arc.

The remaining {SOHO} atmosphere instrument, {LASCO}, uses an occulting disk to mask the Sun's photosphere and view the dim visible sunlight
scattered by free coronal electrons. (At a million degrees, several electrons are set free from each atom, leaving an ion behind.) Since the sky's light confuses such images, the finest detail is obtained from space where the daytime sky is truly and starkly black. The {LASCO} instrument contains three such coronagraphs with nested and overlapping annular fields of view from 1.1 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre, looking closer to, and further from, the Sun than all previous
space-borne coronagraphs.

The coronagraph images will provide electron densities, or the number of electrons per unit volume, specifying their global distribution and radial variation. The inner coronagraph will also permit high-resolution imaging spectroscopy from 1.1 to 3 solar radii. It will measure the intensities and wavelength (Doppler) shifts of visible lines emitted by coronal ions, determining temperature, density and velocity information that will also be used to understand the currently-unknown mechanism for heating the Sun's corona.

The Solar Wind

The hot solar atmosphere, or corona, is expanding into interplanetary space, filling the solar system with a perpetual flow of electrified matter called the solar wind. Unlike any wind on Earth, the solar wind is a rarefied mixture of protons, electrons and magnetic fields, streaming radially outward from the Sun. Thus, the space between the planets is not completely empty, it is filled with charged pieces of the Sun.

At increasing distances from the Sun, where the solar gravity weakens, the hot coronal material creates an outward pressure that overcomes the Sun's gravity, creating a wind that accelerates away to supersonic speeds, like water overflowing a dam. And as the corona disperses, it must be replaced by gases welling up from below to feed the eternal solar wind.

Spacecraft have made in situ (Latin for in original place", or
literally, "in the same place") measurements of the solar wind near the Earth, showing that it manifests itself in two ways, either as wind moving at a relatively slow speed of 300 to 400 kilometres per second, or as high-speed streams of 600 to 800 kilometres per second. What forces propel the solar wind to these supersonic velocities with such tremendous energy, and where do the components of the solar wind come from? The acceleration and origin of the solar wind are not completely known, and are included as principal scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission.

Given the high observed temperatures, the ordinary slow-speed wind is a consequence of its expected outward flow. As this component breaks away from the Sun, it will gain speed with distance, reaching supersonic speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second at a few solar radii from Sun-centre. So, the basic mystery for the acceleration of the slow-speed component is the unknown heat source of the corona. No one really knows how the high-speed stream is accelerated.

And where does the solar wind come from? The high-speed component of the solar wind apparently squirts out of extended regions of low density and temperature in the solar corona. These regions, called coronal holes, appear as large dark areas in {EUV} or X-ray images, seemingly devoid of radiation. The magnetism in the coronal holes stretches radially outward, providing a fast lane for the high-speed wind. However, the source of the low-speed wind remains a mystery to be solved by future {SOHO} observations.

{SOHO}: from the Sun to the Earth

Coronal remote sensing and in-situ experiments on board {SOHO} will provide a comprehensive data set to study the solar wind from its source at the Sun to the Earth. We have already discussed two of them, {UVCS} and {LASCO}, that will determine temperature, density and velocity information in regions near the Sun where the solar wind is accelerated and has its origin (see previous section; {SOHO} Tunes in the Sun’s Atmosphere). Three {SOHO} instruments, {CELIAS}, {COSTEP} and {ERNE}, will analyse in situ that charged particles in the solar wind.

The Charge, {ELement} and Isotope Analysis System, or {CELIAS}, will measure the mass, ionic charge and energy of the low-speed and high-speed solar wind, as well as energetic particles emitted during explosions on the Sun. {COSTEP} ({COmprehensive} {SupraThermal} and Energetic Particle analyser) and {ERNE} (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron experiment) , together form a collaboration to study the energy release and particle acceleration processes in the solar atmosphere, as well as particle propagation in the interplanetary medium. {COSTEP} will measure energy spectra of electrons (up to 5 {MeV}), protons and helium nuclei (up to 52 {MeV}/nucleus). {ERNE} will measure energy spectra of heavier ions (up to 540 {MeV}/nucleus), abundance rations of isotopes and the anisotropy of the particle flux. The Study of Solar Wind {ANisotropies}, or {SWAN}, will make complete sky maps of the hydrogen density in the solar wind, determining the distribution of the solar wind mass flux from equator to pole as well as the variation of this distribution.

Command and control of {SOHO}

{ESA} has overall responsibility for the {SOHO} mission, but {NASA} will provide the launch, tracking and control. The spacecraft will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida by Atlas {IIAS}, the most powerful of the Atlas-Centaur rockets. The satellite will maintain contact with the ground through {NASA}’s Deep Space Network ({DSN}). The {DSN} is a network of three radio antennas spread around the world. One is in Goldstone, {USA}, a second near Madrid, Spain, and a third is placed in Canberra, Australia. Together, these antennas provide
continuous links to spacecraft wherever thy happen to be in relation to Earth.

After the {DSN} has collected the {SOHO} data, it will be routed to
{NASA}’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, {USA},
from where {SOHO} will be commanded. A special facility, known as the {SOHO} Experiment Operations Facility, has been set up at Goddard.. This will serve as the fulcrum for all {SOHO} operation. Scientists will meet there in order to use the spacecraft and to plan the scientific investigations it will be carrying out. The data from all observations will be stored there in an archive and researchers from all over the world will be able to access the information electronically, via computers.

Energising Space Near Earth

Fortunately for life on Earth, the terrestrial magnetic fields shield us from the full blast of the solar wind, deflecting it away from hr Earth and hollowing out a cavity in it. Yet, this magnetic cocoon, called the magnetosphere, is constantly being buffeted, distorted and reshaped by the variable solar wind, and some of it manages to penetrate the Earth's magnetic defence at its weak points. The Sun thereby feeds a vast and shifting web of energetic particles, electric currents and magnetic fields that encircle the Earth in space.

The Sun's gusty solar wind can therefore affect our environment
significantly. It can disturb the Earth's magnetic field, producing geomagnetic storms, create the northern and southern lights (the aurora), disrupt navigation and communication systems, destroy
electronics, endanger astronauts and create electrical power blackouts on Earth. {SOHO}'s investigations of the acceleration, evolution and origin of the solar wind therefore have a direct impact on human activity. Indeed, all of these effects are of such vital importance that national centres employ space weather forecasters and continuously monitor the Sun from the ground and space to warn of threatening solar activity.

The Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme - comprising of {SOHO} and its sister-mission Cluster - are aimed at obtaining a fuller understanding of the vital link between the Sun and the Earth. {SOHO} will look back at the ultimate source of it all, the Sun, in order to identify and analyse the ultimate source of the phenomena that cause terrestrial effects. Cluster will investigate in detail and - being a flotilla of four magnetospheric spacecraft - in three dimensions, the physical mature of the processes that are induced in the near-Earth environment.

"All those who have worked tirelessly on the {SOHO} payload, spacecraft and ground segment are to be congratulated in their excellent work and for having developed the most remarkable tool to help us understand the Sun and its environment, the heliosphere", said Roger Bonnet.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of mode width, Γ, and mean square velocity power, 2{\textgreater}, derived from all currently processed 108 day Global
Oscillation Network Group ({GONG}) time series and discuss their
implications for p-mode excitation and damping. Assuming stochastic excitation, we estimate the energy per mode, E, and the energy supply rate, {dE}/dt. For modes with l=9-150, the mean square velocity power and the mode energy peak at about 3.15 {mHz} reaching values of
2{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1.4×103 cm2 s-2 and
E{\textasciitilde}2.2×1028 ergs. The energy supply rate reaches a
maximum value of {dE}/dt{\textasciitilde}2.5×1023 ergs s-1
near 3.6 {mHz}. The mode width shows the familiar ``plateau'' between 2.5 and 3.1 {mHz} with a ``dip'' near 2.9 {mHz}, which is strongest for l{\textasciitilde}40. This dip is most prominent during solar cycle minimum and disappears with increasing magnetic activity. The energy supply rate decreases on average by about 2.7\% from the previous activity minimum to the
currently highest level of activity. The solar cycle variation of {dE}/dt shows no frequency dependence, which is in marked contrast to the other mode parameters. The mode parameters are adequately represented by power laws in several frequency ranges, for example,
{dE}/dt{\textasciitilde}ν6.89+/-0.07 for 2.4 {mHz}{\textless}=ν{\textless}3.0 {mHz} and
{dE}/dt{\textasciitilde}ν-5.62+/-0.27 for 3.75 {mHz}{\textless}=ν{\textless}4.5 {mHz}. The
solar cycle variation of these parameters can then be expressed as changes of a few percent in the power-law exponents and multipliers. Our results agree reasonably well with previous studies of Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network and Big Bear Solar Observatory data.},

frequencies from a single observing site have met with fundamental limitations imposed by the inevitable interruptions arising from the day-night cycle. To address such problems, the {NSF}-sponsored Global Oscillation Network Group ({GONG}) project has developed a network of six identical instruments around the world providing velocity images nearly continuously, a data processing system that can keep up with the massive data flow, and is supported by a vigorous scientific community
structured around {GONG} teams that have shared in all aspects of the development of the project. Though the primary helioseismic data deals with the frequencies and their splittings for the nearly half-million global acoustic modes detectable with the {GONG} instruments, the data also allows study of how wave fields are locally influenced by flows and magnetic structures below the solar surface, and further provides direct measures of larger-scale flows at the surface. We shall briefly describe the network, instruments, and data analysis, and then review some of the preliminary scientific results obtained by the teams through inversion of the frequency data, dealing with the structure of the solar interior and the physics of stellar models, and an assessment of the differential rotation profile with depth and latitude. Early results will also be presented concerning nearly steady surface flows of the solar surface.},

The sharp-line component first reported by Claverie et al (1979) in the power spectra of whole-disc measurements is due to a near coincidence of the
eigenfrequencies of modes of low degree, which are the modes to which such measurements are most sensitive. Previously, similar observations did not isolate the sharp-line component, in part, because although the amplitudes of the motion observed were consistent with the stated hypothesis, the observing intervals were too short.

	abstract = {The problem of the adiabatic non-radial oscillations of spherical stars is reviewed and results recalled for a variety of models. The anomalous behaviour of the eigenfunctions for highly condensed models is related to the apparent mobile singularities depending on the eigenvalues. Tables of Q-values are provided to facilitate possible applications to variable stars.
In the case of the gravity modes, the existence of multiple spectra some stable (g
+ modes) some unstable (g
− modes) if superadiabatic and subadiabatic regions alternate is discussed and the interest of further investigations underlined.
As far as vibrational stability (effects of the non adiabatic terms) is concerned, a general expression is given for the ‘damping coefficient’. The attention is drawn to the possibility for g
+ modes of becoming vibrationally unstable under the effect of various factors and in various models, including the Sun where this was advocated as a possibility of relieving the neutrinos difficulty.
Finally the present status of the most obvious candidates among variable stars for non-radial oscillations, the β Canis Majoris stars and the rapid blue variables (white dwarfs) is briefly reviewed.},

	abstract = {Recent asteroseismic advances have allowed for direct measurements of the internal rotation rates of many subgiant and red giant stars. Unlike the nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the role of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low-mass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively excited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into subgiants, however, low-frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and cannot propagate below the hydrogen-burning shell, allowing the spin of the core to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the base of the subgiant branch when stars have surface temperatures of T ≈ 5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region, implying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep core near the hydrogen-burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region may also prevent the core from accreting high angular momentum material and slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance shear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of viscous/magnetic torques.},

properties of the inversion, in particular the solution, the inversion coefficients (which relate the solution to the data) and the averaging kernels (which relate the solution to the underlying unknown function). These facilitate an analysis of resolution and error properties. We apply the theory to a helioseismic example and find inter alia that, for our prototypical problem, there is an effective limit to the information content of the mode set in the presence of reasonable data errors which is much less than might have been expected from the number of modes. We show that various popular inversion methods can be analysed using the tools developed here. We find in our helioseismic application that the methods make very similar use of the data.},

This allows great versatility in the choice of target form, and furthermore {SOLA} has the significant advantage of being computationally more efficient than the usual {OLA} formulations. A Gaussian target function is a useful choice, and we use the example of determining the Sun's internal rotation to explore how the parameter values (such as the Gaussian's width) should best be chosen. Some alternatives to using a Gaussian function as target function are discussed and applied to artificial data in a blind experiment. In particular we show that it is possible to invert directly for the gradient of the rotation. This may be of interest if there are localized large gradients in the rotation rate.},

We suppose that a finite set G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] of gross Earth data has been measured, that the measurements are inaccurate, and that the variance matrix of the errors of measurement can be estimated. We show that some such sets G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] of measurements determine the structure of the Earth within certain limits of error except for fine-scale detail. That is, from some sets G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] it is possible to compute localized averages of the Earth structure at various depths. These localized averages will be slightly in error, and their errors will be larger as their resolving lengths are shortened. We show how to determine whether a given set G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] of measured gross Earth data permits such a construction of localized averages, and, if so, how to find the shortest length scale over which G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] gives a local average structure at a particular depth if the variance of the error in computing that local average from G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] is to be less than a specified amount. We apply the general theory to the linear problem of finding the depth variation of a frequency-independent local elastic dissipation (Q) from the observed damping rates of a finite number of normal modes. We also apply the theory to the nonlinear problem of finding density against depth from the total mass, moment and normal-mode frequencies, in case the

	abstract = {A common method to infer that solar properties vary with position is to compare linear estimates of averages of those properties centered at different locations. If some of the confidence intervals for the averages do not overlap, one concludes that the property varies. In order for this conclusion to be statistically valid, the lengths of the intervals must be adjusted to obtain the correct "simultaneous coverage probability." We illustrate the notion of simultaneous coverage
probability using coin tossing as an example. We present four methods for adjusting the lengths of confidence intervals for linear estimates, and a complementary approach to infer changes based on constructing a linear estimator that is directly sensitive to changes. The first method for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals is based on
Bonferroni's inequality, and applies generally to confidence intervals for any set of parameters, from dependent or independent observations. The second method is based on a 2 measure of fit to the data, which allows one to compute s1multaneous confidence intervals for any number of linear functionals of the model. The third method uses a {\textasciicircum}\{2
\}distribution in the space of estimates, which yields "Scheffe'" confidence intervals for the functionals. The fourth method, which produces the shortest confidence intervals, uses the infinity-norm in the space of estimates to construct "maximum-modulus" confidence intervals. We apply the four methods to search for radial changes in averages of solar angular velocity, using data from Big Bear Solar Observatory ({BBSO}) averaged for the 4 yr 1986, 1988-1990. Finally, we apply the new differencing estimator to the {BBSO} data, finding strong evidence that the average solar angular velocity is lower near the poles than near the equator over a range of depths, as is observed at the surface as well.},

It is found that standard solar models are apparently a good approximation to the gross structure of the sun. They can be constructed to reproduce the observed solar luminosity and radius, and with a chemical composition that is not considered abnormal by most astrophysicists they can reproduce quite well the frequencies of the five minute oscillations, for modes of both high and low degree. The only severe point of disagreement might be the neutrino flux, but the theoretical predictions of that flux are presently in doubt.},

Many stars besides the Sun may also be amenable to asteroseismic analysis. Stars of roughly solar type should of course behave in ways similar to the sun, and stars of this sort form a large fraction of the potential targets for asteroseismology. But several other types of stars (delta scuti stars, {roAP} stars, and the pulsating white dwarfs) also have the desired pulsation characteristics. Pulsations in some of these stars are, for various reasons, much easier to observe than in the Sun-like stars. Virtually all unambiguous observations of multi-mode pulsators relate to these other categories of stars. Since oscillation mode frequencies are arguably the most precise measurement relating to a star that we can make, a few tens of such frequencies may still be of great importance to our understanding of the stellar structure and evolution.},

By modeling the expected transits of all confirmed and candidate planets detected by Kepler as expected to be observed by {TESS}, we provide a probabilistic forecast of the detection of each Kepler planet in {TESS} data. We find that {TESS} has a greater than 50\% chance of detecting 260 of these planets at the 3σ level in one sector of observations and an additional 120 planets in two sectors. Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only ∼5\% of known multiply transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect {TESS} to be a powerful tool to characterize transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 ({KOI}-142) as an example, we show that {TESS} will improve measurements of planet–star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Because {TESS} will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether {TESS} will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems. We find two confirmed planetary systems (Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b) and five candidate systems that will be good candidates to detect tidal decay.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201526300},
	abstract = {Context. The signatures of nonlinear effects affecting stellar 
oscillations are difficult to observe from ground observatories because
of the lack of continuous high-precision photometric data spanning
extended enough time baselines. The unprecedented photometric quality
and coverage provided by the Kepler spacecraft offers new opportunities
to search for these phenomena. Aims: We use the Kepler data
accumulated on the pulsating {DB} white dwarf {KIC} 08626021 to explore in
detail the stability of its oscillation modes, searching, in particular,
for evidence of nonlinear behaviors. Methods: We analyze nearly
two years of uninterrupted short-cadence data, concentrating on
identified triplets that are caused by stellar rotation and that show
intriguing behaviors during the course of the observations. 
Results: We find clear signatures of nonlinear effects that could be
attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. These couplings occur
between the components of the triplets and can induce different types of
behaviors. We first notice that a structure at 3681 μHz, identified
as a triplet in previous published studies, is in fact forming a
doublet, with the third component being an independent mode. We find
that a triplet at 4310 μHz and this doublet at 3681 μHz (most
likely the two visible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear
periodic frequency and amplitude modulations, which are typical of the
so-called intermediate regime of the resonance, with timescales
consistent with theoretical expectations. Another triplet at 5073 μHz
is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the amplitudes are
modulated while the frequencies are locked. Using nonadiabatic pulsation
calculations, based on a model representative of {KIC} 08626021 to
evaluate the linear growth rates of the modes in the triplets, we also
provide quantitative information that could be useful for future
comparisons with numerical solutions of the amplitude equations. 
Conclusions: The observed modulations are the clearest hints of
nonlinear resonant couplings occurring in white dwarf stars identified
so far. These should resonate as a warning to projects that aim at
measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of {KIC} 08626021, and of white
dwarf stars in general. Nonlinear modulations of the frequencies can
potentially jeopardize any attempt to measure such rates reliably,
unless they can be corrected beforehand. These results should motivate
further theoretical work to develop the nonlinear stellar pulsation
theory.},

splitting observed in l = 1 modes, we determine a rotational period of
52 days and a stellar inclination angle of 63°. The parameters
obtained through modeling of the observed oscillation frequencies agree
very well with independent observations and imply a stellar mass between
1.11 and 1.15 M ⊙ and an age of

different outer layers we demonstrate that the ratio of the small to
large separations of acoustic oscillations in solar-like stars is
essentially independent of the structure of the outer layers, and is
determined solely by the interior structure. Defining the scaled
Eulerian pressure perturbation psil (omega ,t) = r p' /(rho
c)1/2 we define the internal phase shift deltal
(omega ,t) through the relation omega psi /(dpsi /dt)=tan (omega t -pil
/2 + deltal ). The deltal are almost independent
of acoustic radius t=int dr/c outside the stellar core and can be
determined as a continuous functions of omega from partial wave
solutions for the interior - that is solutions of the oscillation
equations for any omega that satisfy the Laplace boundary condition at
a sufficiently large acoustic radius tf outside the stellar
core. If the omega are eigenfrequencies then they satisfy the
Eigenfrequency Equation omega T=(n+l/2) pi +alpha (omega
)-deltal (omega ) where alpha (omega ) is the l independent
surface phase shift (Roxburgh \& Vorontsov 2000). Using this result
we show that the ratio of small to large separations is determined to
high accuracy solely by the internal phase shifts deltal
(omega ) and hence by the interior structure alone. The error in this
result is estimated and shown to be smaller than that associated with
the errors in the determination of the frequencies ({\textasciitilde}0.1-0.3 mu Hz) from
the upcoming space missions {MOST}, {COROT} and Eddington.},

Kepler long-cadence photometry. The sample includes stars ranging in
evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main
sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency
separation (Δν) and the frequency of maximum power
(νmax) and show that it is different for red giants than
for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models
and scaling relations. The distributions of νmax and
Δν are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar
population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a
secondary clump population characterized by M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2 M sun
and νmax {\textasciitilde}= 40-110 μHz. We measured the small frequency
separations δν02 and δν01 in
over 400 stars and δν03 in over 40. We present C-D
diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation
ratios δν02/Δν and
δν01/Δν have opposite trends as a function
of Δν. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward
lower νmax, in agreement with models predicting more
efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate
the offset epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear
correlation with Δν, demonstrating that it is related to
fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first
amplitude-νmax relation for Kepler red giants. We observe
a lack of low-amplitude stars for νmax {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 110 μHz

stars with lower Δν (and consequently higher mass) tend to show

	abstract = {Context. The {CoRoT} 5-month long observation runs provide us with the opportunity to analyze a large variety of red-giant stars and derive their fundamental parameters from their asteroseismic properties. Aims: We perform an analysis of more than 4600 {CoRoT} light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of both the star sample and the method to ensure that our asteroseismic results are as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants in two opposite regions of the Galaxy. Methods: We analyze the time series using the envelope autocorrelation function to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean wide frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of the maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius. Results: We identify more than 1800 red giants among the 4600 light curves and obtain accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We are able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We derive precise information about the stellar population distribution and the red clump. By comparing the stars observed in two different fields, we find that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but that the characteristics are different for red-clump stars. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficiency of statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer fundamental stellar parameters, derive precise information about red-giant evolution and interior structure, analyze and compare stellar populations from different fields.

difference of the Δν-νmax relation for unevolved
and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in
effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is
expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show
that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling
relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and
demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate
luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the
main sequence to red giants to a precision of {\textasciitilde}25\%. The residuals show
an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an
additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the
observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and
stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude
suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the
location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the
detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid

a few percent and seem therefore robust to the different analysis

negligible and should be taken into account when using these results for

	abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations δL/L can be
derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy (δL/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_.
Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of
v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be
δL/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469).
However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., α Cen A and β Hyi), observations have not yet
reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum
(νmax) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off
frequency (νc). Using the {SoHO} {GOLF} observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between
νmax and νc, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.},

This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth’s interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe
the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from
the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red
giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently
detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models,
we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the
surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction
of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar
interior.},

	abstract = {Core rotation rates have been measured for red giant stars using 
asteroseismology. These data, along with helioseismic measurements and
open cluster spin-down studies, provide powerful clues about the nature
and timescale for internal angular momentum transport in stars. We focus
on two cases: the metal-poor red giant {KIC} 7341231 ("Otto") and
intermediate-mass core helium burning stars. For both, we examine
limiting case studies for angular momentum coupling between cores and
envelopes under the assumption of rigid rotation on the main sequence.
We discuss the expected pattern of core rotation as a function of mass
and radius. In the case of Otto, strong post-main-sequence coupling is
ruled out and the measured core rotation rate is in the range of 23-33
times the surface value expected from standard spin-down models. The
minimum coupling timescale (0.17-0.45 Gyr) is significantly longer than
that inferred for young open cluster stars. This implies ineffective
internal angular momentum transport in early first ascent giants. By
contrast, the core rotation rates of evolved secondary clump stars are
found to be consistent with strong coupling given their rapid
main-sequence rotation. An extrapolation to the white dwarf regime
predicts rotation periods between 330 and 0.0052 days, depending on mass
and decoupling time. We identify two key ingredients that explain these
features: the presence of a convective core and inefficient angular
momentum transport in the presence of larger mean molecular weight
gradients. Observational tests that can disentangle these effects are
discussed.},

constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. Methods: We computed models of {KIC} 7341231 including a treatment of shellular rotation, and we compared the rotation profiles obtained with the one derived from observations. We then modify some modeling parameters in order to quantify their effect on the obtained rotation profile. Moreover, we mimicked a powerful angular momentum transport during the main sequence and studied its effect on the evolution of the rotation profile during the subgiant and red giant phases. Results: We show that meridional
circulation and shear mixing alone produce a rotation profile for {KIC} 7341231 that is too steep compared to the observed one. An additional mechanism is then needed to increase the internal transport of angular momentum. We find that this undetermined mechanism has to be efficient not only during the main sequence but also during the much quicker subgiant phase. Moreover, we point out the importance of studying the whole rotational history of a star to explain its rotation profile during the red giant evolution.},

in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a
red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes
fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include
uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium
ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other
processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between
red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning
hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a
powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their
natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of
gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction
between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry
obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure
oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose
dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings.
These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish
unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing
mostly {\textasciitilde}50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period
spacing {\textasciitilde}100 to 300 seconds).},

One of these stars, the subgiant {KIC} 11026764, exhibits a characteristic

to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously.
We determine both the radius and the age of {KIC} 11026764 with a
precision near 1\%, and an accuracy near 2\% for the radius and 15\% for
the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal

short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create
frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star,
we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as
frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo “peak-bagging” approach. We report the extracted mode
parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as
frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{\{Δ

with frequency and line widths at \{ν \}{\textbackslash}max with
\{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior
of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future
peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar

constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode
line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and

Tests using pairs of known solar models show that this technique is capable of reproducing the sound speed to an accuracy of better than 0.1\% for r{\textless}0.97Rsun\_ , while the density can be determined to an accuracy of better than 0.5\% in most of the radiative interior. Using the observed frequencies of solar oscillations it is found that the sound speed and density in a solar model with gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements is very close to that in the Sun, the maximum difference being 0.5\% for the sound speed and 1.5\% for density. It is possible to use this technique to obtain the adiabatic index \{{GAMMA}\}\_1\_ inside the Sun, which can be employed as a probe for the equation of state in stellar interiors. The relative sound speed difference between the reference solar model and the Sun just below the He ii ionization zone indicates that the
adiabatic index of the solar material in this region is smaller than that in the model. The inverted density profile is found to be stable against convection in the solar core, while the depth of the surface convection zone is found to be approximately 0.29Rsun\_.},

	abstract = {Methods. We used asteroseismic rotational inversions to probe the internal stellar rotation proﬁles in red-giant models from the base of the red-giant branch up to the luminosity bump. We used the inversion method of multiplicative optimally localised averages to assess how well internal and surface rotation rates can be recovered from diﬀerent mode sets and diﬀerent synthetic rotation proﬁles.
Results. We conﬁrm that dipole mixed modes are suﬃcient to set constraints on the average core-rotation rates in red giants. However, surface-rotation rates estimated with only dipole mixed modes are contaminated by the core rotation. We show that the sensitivity to surface rotation decreases from the base of the red-giant branch until it reaches a minimum at 60–80\% of the bump luminosity due to a glitch in the buoyancy frequency. Thereafter, a narrow range of increased surface sensitivity just below the bump luminosity exists. Quadrupole and octopole modes have more sensitivity in the outer parts of the star. To obtain accurate estimates of rotation rates at intermediate radii (i.e. a fractional radius of ∼0.4), acoustic oscillation modes with a spherical degree of l ≈ 10 are needed.
Conclusions. We ﬁnd a minimum and subsequent maximum in the sensitivity to the surface rotation rate in red giants below the luminosity bump. Furthermore, we show that, if observed, quadrupole and octopole modes enable us to distinguish between diﬀerential and solid body rotation in the convection zone. This will be important when investigating the transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope.},

We aim to develop a simple model of the information content of asteroseismology and to characterize the ability and precision with which fundamental properties of stars can be estimated for different space missions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We defined and calibrated metrics of the seismic performance. The metrics, expressed by a seismic index ℰ defined by simple scaling relations, are calculated for an ensemble of stars. We studied the relations between the properties of mission observations, fundamental stellar properties, and the performance index. We also defined thresholds for asteroseismic detection and measurement of different stellar properties.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We find two regimes of asteroseismic performance: the first where the signal strength is dominated by stellar properties and not by observational noise; and the second where observational properties dominate. Typically, for evolved stars, stellar properties provide the dominant terms in estimating the information content, while main sequence stars fall in the regime where the observational properties, especially stellar magnitude, dominate. We estimate scaling relations to predict ℰ with an intrinsic scatter of around 21\%. Incidentally, the metrics allow us to distinguish stars burning either hydrogen or helium.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}i/{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {The Kepler mission has provided exquisite data to perform an ensemble 
asteroseismic analysis on evolved stars. In this work we systematically
characterize solar-like oscillations and granulation for 16,094
oscillating red giants, using end-of-mission long-cadence data. We
produced a homogeneous catalog of the frequency of maximum power
(typical uncertainty \{σ \}\{ν {\textbackslash}max \}=1.6 \%
), the mean large frequency separation (\{σ \}\{\{Δ
\}ν \}=0.6 \% ), oscillation amplitude (\{σ
\}\{\{A\}\}=4.7 \% ), granulation power (\{σ
\}gran\}=8.6 \% ), power excess width (\{σ
\}width\}=8.8 \% ), seismically derived stellar mass (\{σ
\}\{\{M\}\}=7.8 \% ), radius (\{σ \}\{\{R\}\}=2.9 \% ),
and thus surface gravity (\{σ \}logg\}=0.01 dex). Thanks
to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch ({RGB})
and helium-core-burning ({HeB}) stars collectively differ in the
distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of
power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The
distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper
edge at fixed \{ν \}{\textbackslash}max , which might hold clues for
understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation
modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power
depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes
and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5
dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable
distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic
stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an
excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes,
and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large
spectroscopic surveys such as {APOGEE} and {LAMOST}.},

than 13,000 (over 85\%) of these stars show intrinsic flux variability

asteroseismic investigations. We automatically extracted individual
frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipole modes in
nearly every red giant. These measurements naturally classify the stars
into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass

the higher-mass (M/M ⊙ {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1.8) secondary clump. The

rotationally induced frequency splittings. This sample of stars will
undoubtedly provide an extremely valuable source for studying the

determine radii, masses, and ages for all stars in the sample.
Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement
in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety
of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different
teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of ∼2\% in radius,
∼4\% in mass, and ∼10\% in age, making this the best-characterized
sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial
abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences
from chemical enrichment laws ΔY/ΔZ and predictions from 3D
atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar
properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements,
Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in
all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically
determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of
oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs {LEGACY} sample,
these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic

	abstract = {We present results of a long-baseline interferometry campaign using the 
{PAVO} beam combiner at the {CHARA} Array to measure the angular sizes of
five main-sequence stars, one subgiant and four red giant stars for
which solar-like oscillations have been detected by either Kepler or
{CoRoT}. By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos
parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and
high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of
near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first
use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the
frequency of maximum power (νmax) and the large frequency
separation (Δν). We find excellent agreement within the
observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates
of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 4\%.
We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective
temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean
deviations for stars between T eff = 4600-6200 K of -22
± 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 ± 31 K (with
a scatter of 93 K), respectively. Finally, we present a first comparison
with evolutionary models, and find differences between observed and
theoretical properties for the metal-rich main-sequence star {HD} 173701.
We conclude that the constraints presented in this study will have
strong potential for testing stellar model physics, in particular when

the inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the
small frequency separation of component B. We try to answer the question

statistically reliable dependence of the α-parameter on the {HR}

observables to determine the fundamental stellar parameters, and to use
the large frequency separation and frequencies to extract information

Here, we present the analysis of data from 10 days observing run carried out in November 1998. We detect significant excess in the power between 0.5-1.5 {mHz} in the periodograms of the time series of mean Doppler shifts. Observations of eta Cas made with the same instrument during the same time interval and in almost identical night conditions show a flat spectrum in this frequency range, indicating that the excess of Doppler signal seen on Procyon is of stellar origin. When data from the whole run are jointly analyzed, a period analysis places an upper limit of 0.50-0.60 ms-1 for the amplitude of oscillations, while the frequency cutoff is around 1.5 {mHz}. The power evidently drops near 0.55 and 1.5 {mHz} on the average of unfiltered power spectra of individual nights, which is consistent with the expected p-mode oscillation properties for Procyon. Several equispaced peaks in frequency are recurrent in the power spectra of two independent segments of 4 and 3 contiguous nights; the most probable frequency spacing seems to be 55 mu Hz. In conclusion, we now have an instrument set-up which is
sufficiently stable and fast to be used for a multi-site campaign involving instruments with comparable velocity precisions, to detect the oscillation modes of sun-like stars. Based on observations obtained at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence ({CNRS}, France)},

scanned. Its phase is measured and translated directly into velocity
with an absolute calibration, providing a sensitive measurement of the

the spectrum beyond 0.8 {mHz} is as low as 0.12 m s(-1\}.{muHz} (\{-1/2)) .
Even with this noise level, in a single site observation we cannot
report a firm detection of p-modes. We do not detect any significant
excess in the power spectrum near 1 {mHz}. A limit on the amplitude of the
modes can be deduced, which cannot exceed 1 m s(-1) . However, the
``comb response'' exhibits the signature of a possible regular pattern
with a large splitting nu\_0 of 53 mu Hz, which would indicate that a
signal of stellar origin has been detected. Both values agree with
theoretical predictions, but are in contradiction with claimed detection

Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation,

The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so
conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well.

	abstract = {For this invited contribution, I was asked to give an overview about the 
application of helio and aster-oseismic techniques to study the interior
of giant planets, and to specifically present the recent observations of
Neptune by Kepler K2. Seismology applied to giant planets could
drastically change our understanding of their deep interiors, as it has
happened with the Earth, the Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved
stars. The study of giant planets' composition is important for
understanding both the mechanisms enabling their formation and the
origins of planetary systems, in particular our own. Unfortunately, its
determination is complicated by the fact that their interior is thought
not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of
atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as
a whole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure
must rely on indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets
are mostly fluid and convective, which makes their seismology much
closer to that of solar-like stars than that of terrestrial planets.
Hence, helioseismology techniques naturally transfer to giant planets.
In addition, two alternative methods can be used: photometry of the
solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and ring seismology in
the specific case of Saturn. The current decade has been promising
thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic oscillations with the
ground-based imaging-spectrometer {SYMPA} and indirect detection of
Saturn's f-modes in its rings by the {NASA} Cassini orbiter. This has
motivated new projects of ground-based and space-borne instruments that
are under development. The K2 observations represented the first
opportunity to search for planetary oscillations with visible
photometry. Despite the excellent quality of K2 data, the noise level of
the power spectrum of the light curve was not low enough to detect
Neptune's oscillations. The main results from the K2 observations are
the clear detection of the well-known differential rotation of Neptune,
measured for the first time through the rotational modulation of its
photometry, and the detection of the Sun's oscillations, for the first
time in an indirect way in intensity measurements.},

capabilities, in particular its 360° ecliptic field of view, is
galactic archaeology—the study of the evolution of the Galaxy from
the fossil stellar record. The thrust of this research is to exploit
high-precision, time-resolved photometry from K2 in order to detect
oscillations in red giant stars. This asteroseismic information can
provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass, and age of
vast numbers of stars across the Galaxy. Here we present the initial
analysis of a subset of red giants, observed toward the north galactic
gap, during the mission’s first full science campaign. We
investigate the feasibility of using K2 data for detecting oscillations
in red giants that span a range in apparent magnitude and evolutionary
state (hence intrinsic luminosity). We demonstrate that oscillations are
detectable for essentially all cool giants within the \{log\}g range
∼1.9-3.2. Our detection is complete down to \{{\textbackslash}text\{Kp\}\} ∼ 14.5,

	abstract = {The Kepler space mission has made it possible to measure the rotational splittings of mixed modes in red giants, thereby providing an unprecedented opportunity to probe the internal rotation of these stars. Asymmetries have been detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is unexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far are found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces symmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a way of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet asymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical \$l=2\$ multiplets of the Kepler young red giant {KIC}7341231 and obtain precise estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected multiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for \$l=2\$ mixed modes all along the red giant branch ({RGB}). For \$l=1\$ modes, these effects can be neglected only at the base of the {RGB}. They must therefore be taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here, they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.},

	abstract = {Context. Stellar rotation affects the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum and is therefore a key process during stellar evolution, which is still not fully understood. This is especially true for massive {OB}-type stars, which are important for the chemical enrichment of the Universe. It is therefore important to constrain the physical parameters and internal angular momentum distribution of massive {OB}-type stars to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally split non radial oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars more massive than the Sun. The slowly pulsating B9V star {HD} 201433 is known to be part of a single-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting with periods of about 3.3 and 154 days. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure the internal rotation profile of {HD} 201433 and investigate the tidal interaction with the close companion. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Methods: We used probabilistic methods to analyse the {BRITE} - Constellation photometry and radial velocity measurements, to identify a representative stellar model, and to determine the internal rotation profile of the star. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: Our results are based on photometric observations made by {BRITE} - Constellation and the Solar Mass Ejection Imager on board the Coriolis satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 yr of radial velocity measurements. We identify a sequence of nine frequency doublets in the photometric time series, consistent with rotationally split dipole modes with a period spacing of about 5030 s. We establish that {HD} 201433 is in principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297 ± 76 days. Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of {HD} 201433 is also reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of about 0.9 s during the last 96 yr. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Combining the asteroseismic inferences with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner binary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central {SPB} star and its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit.

	abstract = {Context. Stellar rotation affects the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum and is therefore a key process during stellar evolution, which is still not fully understood. This is especially true for massive {OB}-type stars, which are important for the chemical enrichment of the Universe. It is therefore important to constrain the physical parameters and internal angular momentum distribution of massive {OB}-type stars to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally split non radial oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars more massive than the Sun. The slowly pulsating B9V star {HD} 201433 is known to be part of a single-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting with periods of about 3.3 and 154 days. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure the internal rotation profile of {HD} 201433 and investigate the tidal interaction with the close companion. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Methods: We used probabilistic methods to analyse the {BRITE} - Constellation photometry and radial velocity measurements, to identify a representative stellar model, and to determine the internal rotation profile of the star. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: Our results are based on photometric observations made by {BRITE} - Constellation and the Solar Mass Ejection Imager on board the Coriolis satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 yr of radial velocity measurements. We identify a sequence of nine frequency doublets in the photometric time series, consistent with rotationally split dipole modes with a period spacing of about 5030 s. We establish that {HD} 201433 is in principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297 ± 76 days. Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of {HD} 201433 is also reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of about 0.9 s during the last 96 yr. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Combining the asteroseismic inferences with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner binary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central {SPB} star and its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit. They have, however, not yet aligned all spins of the system and have just begun to synchronise rotation. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data collected by the {BRITE} - Constellation satellite mission, built, launched and operated thanks to support from the Austrian Aeronautics and Space Agency and the University of Vienna, the Canadian Space Agency ({CSA}), and the Foundation for Polish Science \&amp; Technology ({FNiTP} {MNiSW}) and National Science Centre ({NCN}), the Hermes spectrograph mounted on the 1.2 m Mercator Telescope at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, and the Solar Mass Ejection Imager, which is a joint project of the University of California San Diego, Boston College, the University of Birmingham ({UK}), and the Air Force Research Laboratory.},

	abstract = {Space-based observations of solar-like oscillations present an opportunity to constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic difference that must be corrected. We introduce and evaluate two parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough (1990). The first we call a cubic term proportional to \${\textbackslash}nu{\textasciicircum}3/{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$ and the second has an additional inverse term proportional to \${\textbackslash}nu{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}/{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}nu\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$ are the frequency and inertia of an oscillation mode. We first show that these formulae accurately correct model frequencies of two different solar models ... We then incorporate the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations of the well-studied {CoRoT} target {HD}52265. For comparison, we also run the pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (2008). The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for {HD}52265 are consistent with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is significantly worse but yields consistent parameters ... We find that the cubic term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to implement in an existing pipeline. ... This parametrization is thus a useful new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode frequencies can be exploited.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Accurate modelling of solar-like oscillators requires that modelled mode frequencies are corrected for the systematic shift caused by improper modelling of the near-surface layers, known as the surface effect. Several parametrizations of the surface effect are now available but they have not yet been systematically compared with observations of stars showing modes with mixed {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}p{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode character.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We investigate how much additional uncertainty is introduced to stellar model parameters by our uncertainty about the functional form of the surface effect. At the same time, we test whether any of the parametrizations is significantly better or worse at modelling observed subgiants and low-luminosity red giants.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We model six stars observed by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler {\textless}i/{\textgreater}that show clear mixed modes. We fix the input physics of the stellar models and vary the choice of surface correction between five parametrizations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Models using a solar-calibrated power law correction consistently fit the observations more poorly than the other four corrections. Models with the remaining four corrections generally fit the observations about equally well, with the combined surface correction by Ball \& Gizon perhaps being marginally superior. The fits broadly agree on the model parameters within about the 2{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} uncertainties, with discrepancies between the modified Lorentzian and free power law corrections occasionally exceeding the 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} level. Relative to the best-fitting values, the total uncertainties on the masses, radii and ages of the stars are all less than 2, 1 and 6 per cent, respectively.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}A solar-calibrated power law, as formulated by Kjeldsen et al., appears unsuitable for use with more evolved solar-like oscillators. Among the remaining surface corrections, the uncertainty in the model parameters introduced by the surface effects is about twice as large as the uncertainty in the individual fits for these six stars. Though the fits are thus somewhat less certain because of our uncertainty of how to manage the surface effect, these results also demonstrate that it is feasible to model the individual mode frequencies of subgiants and low-luminosity red giants, and hence also use these individual stars to help to constrain stellar models.},

We present revised stellar properties for 197,096 Kepler targets observed between Quarters 1-17 (Q1-17), which were used for the final transiting planet search run by the Kepler Mission (Data Release 25, {DR}25). Similar to the Q1-16 catalog by Huber et al., the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted method and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities, or metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ∼27\% in radius, ∼17\% in mass, and ∼51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved \{log\}g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants. We discuss the overall changes of radii and masses of Kepler targets as a function of spectral type, with a particular focus on exoplanet host stars.},

	abstract = {In this article we first review the main physical effects to be considered in the building of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence ({MS}). The internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion processes, and mass loss. In turn, differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper {MS}, for red giants, supergiants, and W-R stars. A fast rotation enhances the mass loss by stellar winds and, conversely, high mass loss removes a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the breakup or Ω-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be and {LBV} stars. The effects of rotation on the tracks in the {HR} diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue-to-red supergiant ratios, the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars, and the chemical abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and {AGB} stars are reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are examined, along with the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity Ω as well.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation is a strong function of both mass and evolutionary state. Missions such as Kepler and {CoRoT} provide tens of thousands of rotation periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations (∼0.4–2.0 M☉). We find that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence ({MS}) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the {MS} with high rotation rates. Intermediate rotators (10–40 days) can be either cool {MS} dwarfs, suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses. Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There exists a period–age relation for subgiants distinct from the {MS} period–age relations. There is also a period–radius relation that can be used as a constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on the {MS} persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.},

	abstract = {Context. The size of convective cores remains uncertain, despite their substantial influence on stellar evolution, and thus on stellar ages. The seismic modeling of young subgiants can be used to obtain indirect constraints on the core structure during main sequence, thanks to the high probing potential of mixed modes.
Aims. We selected the young subgiant {KIC}10273246, observed by Kepler , based on its mixed-mode properties. We thoroughly modeled this star, with the aim of placing constraints on the size of its main-sequence convective core. A corollary goal of this study is to elaborate a modeling technique that is suitable for subgiants and can later be applied to a larger number of targets.
Methods. We first extracted the parameters of the oscillation modes of the star using the full Kepler data set. To overcome the challenges posed by the seismic modeling of subgiants, we propose a method that is specifically tailored to subgiants with mixed modes and uses nested optimization. We then applied this method to perform a detailed seismic modeling of {KIC}10273246.
Results. We obtain models that show good statistical agreements with the observations, both seismic and non-seismic. We show that including core overshooting in the models significantly improves the quality of the seismic fit, optimal models being found for α ov = 0.15. Higher amounts of core overshooting strongly worsen the agreement with the observations and are thus firmly ruled out. We also find that having access to two g -dominated mixed modes in young subgiants allows us to place stronger constraints on the gradient of molecular weight in the core and on the central density.
Conclusions. This study confirms the high potential of young subgiants with mixed modes to investigate the size of main-sequence convective cores. It paves the way for a more general study including the subgiants observed with Kepler , {TESS}, and eventually {PLATO}.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismic measurements of the internal rotation of subgiants and red giants all show the need for invoking a more efficient transport of angular momentum than theoretically predicted. Constraints on the core rotation rate are available starting from the base of the red giant branch ({RGB}) and we are still lacking information on the internal rotation of less evolved subgiants. We identified two young Kepler subgiants, {KIC}8524425 and {KIC}5955122, whose mixed modes are clearly split by rotation. Using the full Kepler data set, we extracted the mode frequencies and rotational splittings for the two stars using a Bayesian approach. We then performed a detailed seismic modeling of both targets and used the rotational kernels to invert their internal rotation profiles. We found that both stars are rotating nearly as solid bodies, with core-envelope contrasts of \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}/{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}=0.68{\textbackslash}pm0.47\$ for {KIC}8524425 and \$0.72{\textbackslash}pm0.37\$ for {KIC}5955122. This result shows that the internal transport of angular momentum has to occur faster than the timescale at which differential rotation is forced in these stars (between 300 Myr and 600 Myr). By modeling the additional transport of angular momentum as a diffusive process with a constant viscosity \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm add\}\$, we found that values of \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm add\}{\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}4\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ are required to account for the internal rotation of {KIC}8524425, and \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm add\}{\textgreater}1.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5\${\textasciitilde}cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for {KIC}5955122. These values are lower than or comparable to the efficiency of the core-envelope coupling during the main sequence, as given by the surface rotation of stars in open clusters. On the other hand, they are higher than the viscosity needed to reproduce the rotation of subgiants near the base of the {RGB}.

	abstract = {Rotational mixing is a prime candidate for explaining the gradual depletion of lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence. However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and stellar data in the sense that they overestimate the internal differential rotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly differentially rotating at young ages but approach a solid body rotation during their lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an additional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for explaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for mixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a ∼20 Myr timescale is required to explain the evolution of the mean rotation pattern along the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate description of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling produces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little mixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr, in agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances we argue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence decreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss the implications of this finding for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic fields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility of intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters using M67 as an example.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01772},
	abstract = {Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars increases over time and adopt an age--velocity--dispersion relation ({AVR}) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an {AVR}. Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an {RMS} of 1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine learning algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the {McQuillian} et al. (2014) catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25\%. Using predicted rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed age--element abundance trends with literature values.},

From these we select a subsample of 8,977 stars on the main-sequence with highly precise rotation period measurements. With this sample we recover the gap in the rotation period-color diagram first reported by {McQuillan} et al. (2013). While the gap was tentatively detected in Reinhold \& Hekker (2020), this work represents the first robust detection of the gap in K2 data. This is significant because K2 observed along many lines of sight at wide angular separation, in contrast to Kepler's single line of sight. We interpret this gap as evidence for a departure from the \$t{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\$ Skumanich spin down law rather than an indication of a bimodal star formation history. We provide maximum likelihood estimates and uncertainties for all parameters of the quasi-periodic light curve model for each of the 284,834 stars in our sample.},

	abstract = {Stellar surface rotation carries information about stellar parameters---particularly ages---and thus the large rotational datasets extracted from Kepler timeseries represent powerful probes of stellar populations. In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such datasets with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias and confusion to predict the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard "vanilla" assumptions. We arrive at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and observational uncertainties. By assuming that the amplitude and thus detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number, we show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent "Rossby edge" at \${\textbackslash}textrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\} = 2.08\$, above which long-period, high-Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This \${\textbackslash}textrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\}\$ is comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed the onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified braking is in operation in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity at a very similar Rossby number. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing scenarios. (abridged)},

Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period–temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by {McQuillan} et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M☉. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between ∼950 ppm (5th percentile) and ∼22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ∼5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ∼5400 K.},

Interpreting the modulation of stellar light that is caused by star-spots on the time scale of the rotational period depends on knowing the fundamental stellar parameters. Constraints on the angular momentum distribution can be extracted from the true stellar rotational period. By using models with an internal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of rotation periods of subgiant stars we investigate the agreement between theoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can also reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational period measurements from subgiant light curves. We can prove that an evolution assuming solid body rotation is incompatible with the direct measurement of the rotational periods of subgiant stars. Measuring the rotation periods relies on two different periodogram procedures, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and the Plavchan periodogram. Angular momentum evolution models were computed to give us the expected rotation periods for subgiants, which we compared with measured rotational periods. We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal that is compatible in terms of both phase and amplitude with rotational modulation. Rotation periods were directly measured from light curves for 30 subgiant stars and indicate a range of 30 to 100 d for their rotational periods. Our models reproduce the rotational periods obtained from {CoRoT} light curves. These new measurements of rotation periods and stellar models probe the non-rigid rotation of subgiant stars.},

	abstract = {Red giant stars present mixed modes, which behave as pressure modes in the convective envelope and as gravity modes in the radiative interior. This mixed character allows to probe the physical conditions in their core. With the advent of long-duration time series from space-borne missions such as {CoRoT} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, it becomes possible to study the red giant core rotation. As more than 15 000 red giant light curves have been recorded, it is crucial to develop a robust and efficient method to measure this rotation. Such measurements of thousands of mean core rotation would open the way to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms that are able to transport angular momentum from the core to the envelope in red giants. In this work, we detail the principle of the method we developed to obtain automatic measurements of the red giant mean core rotation. This method is based on the stretching of the oscillation spectra and on the use of the so-called Hough transform. We finally validate this method for stars on the red giant branch, where overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings produce complicated frequency spectra.},

	abstract = {Stars of spectral classes A and late B are almost entirely radiative. {CP} stars are a slowly rotating subgroup of these stars. It is possible that they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase. Magnetic coupling of disk and star leads to rotational braking at the surface of the star. Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and will not be able to reduce the rotation rate of the core of the star. We investigate the question of whether the magneto-rotational instability can provide turbulent angular momentum transport. We discuss whether differential rotation is present in {CP} stars. Numerical {MHD} simulations of thick stellar shells are performed. An initial differential rotation law is subject to the influence of a magnetic field. This configuration does indeed give rise to a magneto-rotational instability. The emerging flows and magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards. Weak dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number ({\textasciitilde}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in stars) is found from the simulations. First tests with stratified shells show different flows, but the same efficiency of angular-momentum transport. Since the estimated time-scale of decay of differential rotation is 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}7{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}–10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}8{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} yr, and comparable to the life-time of A stars, we find the braking of the core to be an ongoing process in many {CP} stars. The evolution of the surface rotation of {CP} stars with age will be an observational challenge, and of considerable value in verifying these simulations.},

	abstract = {We continue our study of a powerful weak-field {MHD} instability. Consequences of the instability for pressure-supported systems
are discussed, with emphasis upon stellar radiative zones. It is suggested that the instability, rather than hydromagnetic
waves, is responsible for establishing uniform rotation in weakly magnetized stellar radiative zones. When the Brunt–Väisälä
frequency much exceeds the rotation frequency, only displacements in spherical shells are unstable. Thus the transport induced
by the instability is tangential and leads to little radial mixing. If angular velocity is initially constant on cylinders,
the effect of the instability is to transport angular momentum from the poles to the equator. If angular momentum is locally
deposited by thermalization of the instability, this will probably have the effect of establishing solid-body rotation in
radiative zones. If angular momentum is not deposited locally, it will tend to accumulate in the mid-plane of the star, with
uncertain consequences. It may contribute to an anisotropic wind.

A review of the instability in discs is also presented.},

	abstract = {The reason for the observed thinness of the solar tachocline is still not well understood. One of the explanations that have been proposed is that a primordial magnetic field renders the rotation uniform in the radiation zone. We test here the validity of this magnetic scenario through 3D numerical {MHD} simulations that encompass both the radiation zone and the convection zone. The numerical simulations are performed with the anelastic spherical harmonics ({ASH}) code. The computational domain extends from \$0.07{\textbackslash};R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ to \$0.97{\textbackslash};R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. In the parameter regime we explored, a dipolar fossil field aligned with the rotation axis can not remain confined in the radiation zone. When the field lines are allowed to interact with turbulent unstationary convective motions at the base of the convection zone, 3D effects prevent the field confinement. In agreement with previous work, we find that a dipolar fossil field, even when it is initially buried deep inside the radiation zone, will spread into the convective zone. According to Ferraro's law of iso-rotation, it then imprints on the radiation zone the latitudinal differential rotation of the convection zone, which is not observed.},

There is a thin transition layer between these zones, called the tachocline4. This structure has been measured seismologically1,2,3, but no purely fluid-dynamical mechanism can explain its existence. Here we argue that a self-consistent model requires a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun's interior, as well as consideration of the Coriolis effects in the convection zone and in the tachocline. Turbulent stresses in the convection zone induce (through Coriolis effects) a meridional circulation, causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards, thereby generating the horizontal and vertical shear that characterizes the tachocline. The interior magnetic field stops the burrowing, and confines the shear, as demanded by the observed structure of the tachocline. We outline a dynamical theory of the flow, from which we estimate a field strength of about 10−4 tesla just beneath the tachocline. An important test of this picture, after numerical refinement, will be quantitative consistency between the predicted and observed interior angular velocities.},

We further calculated the scalings of the meridional circulation, entropy gradient and baroclinicity. In this companion paper we compare these predictions with a variety of observations and numerical simulations. With a few exceptions we find that these are consistent in both the slowly-rotating and rapidly-rotating limits.

	abstract = {Context: The observations of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars have brought important constraints on their internal rotation rates. To correctly reproduce these data, an efficient transport mechanism is needed in addition to meridional circulation and shear instability. Aims: We study the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results: The precise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates available for the six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum needed for each of these subgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the uncertainties related to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence phase. An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants (typical values of log(g) close to 4), because their rotational properties are sensitive to the degree of radial differential rotation on the main sequence. These young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain the transport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic observations of evolved stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency of the additional transport process increases with the mass of the star during the subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined mechanism decreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found for red giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that increases with the degree of radial differential rotation cannot account for the core rotation rates of subgiants, while it correctly reproduces the rotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature of the additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum may be different in subgiant and red giant stars.},

	shorttitle = {When Gaussian Process Meets Big Data},
	abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process ({GP}) regression, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable {GPs} have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable {GPs} in the {GP} community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable {GPs} involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable {GPs} are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementation of scalable {GPs} in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PhDT........24W},
	abstract = {The thesis topic is the stochastic excitation of the solar p-modes by turbulent convection, and the work consists of four parts: three theoretical sections and one observational. In the first section of the thesis, an explicit calculation of the acoustic radiation of a buoyant oscillating bubble is presented as a model for the excitation of the solar p-modes. The central scientific issue addressed in this work is the cancellation of monopole and dipole radiation fields in an
anisotropic medium, first pointed out by Goldreich and Kumar (1990). When the bubble oscillation frequency is small compared to the acoustic cutoff, the monopole and dipole disturbances cancel to the quadrupole order in the far field. The second section deals with the role of convective structures in a wide number of problems, including the creation of acoustic disturbances, the transport of heat and magnetic fields, and the penetration of flows into stable layers of the
atmosphere (overshoot). A model of plume convection is developed to discuss these issues. It is argued that the scaleheight-sized flows (the only energetically significant ones) are properly characterized as coherent, entropy-preserving plumes, in contradistinction to the picture of amorphous parcels of fluid suggested by the Mixing Length Theory, and in spite of the large Reynolds numbers typical in astrophysical
convection. The third section of the thesis is an analysis of
high-resolution surface velocity data taken with a magneto-optical filter on the 10 inch telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Estimates are obtained for the frequencies and amplitudes of the solar
oscillations of high spherical harmonic degree (l approximately less than 2000). The observed mode energies follow a Boltzmann distribution (P(E) varies as exp(-E/(bar-E)), as is predicted in the stochastic excitation model. In the final section of the thesis, a derivation of the variational principle for an incompressible fluid is presented. The Lagrange and Hamiltonian densities are calculated to third order in the displacement field, and these results are suitable to study the
non-linear interactions among incompressible modes.},

	abstract = {Context. The Kepler space telescope has provided time series of red giants of such unprecedented quality that a detailed asteroseismic analysis becomes possible. For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios,
predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13
low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode
identifications. Aims: We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. Methods: We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. Results: We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

Because the Sun’s rotation frequency is of the same order as that of the waves, it is now necessary to refine our description of wave propagation and to take into account the action of the Coriolis acceleration in a coherent way. To achieve this goal, we adopt the traditional approximation, which can be applied to stellar radiation zones under conditions that are given. We present the modified transport equations and their numerical evaluation in a parameter range that is significant for the Sun.

helioseismology has probably been one of the most successful fields of
astrophysics. Besides the improvement of observational data, solar
seismologists developed sophisticated techniques to infer the internal
structure of the Sun. Back in the 1990s these comparisons showed a very
high agreement between solar models and the Sun. However, the downward
revision of the {CNO} surface abundances in the Sun in 2005, confirmed in
2009, induced a drastic reduction of this agreement leading to the
so-called solar modelling problem. More than ten years later, in the era
of the space-based photometry missions which have established
asteroseismology of solar-like stars as a standard approach to obtain
their masses, radii and ages, the solar modelling problem still awaits a
solution. I will briefly present the results of new helioseismic
inversions, discuss the current uncertainties of solar models and
possible solutions to the solar modelling problem. I will also discuss
how the solar problem can have significant implications for
asteroseismology as a whole by discussing the modelling of the

The ages of red giants must instead be estimated with reference to grids of theoretical stellar models, which can be computationally intensive. Here I present an exhaustive search for scaling age relations involving different combinations of observable quantities. The candidate scaling relations are calibrated and tested using more than 1,000 red giant stars whose ages were obtained via grid-based modeling. I report multiple high-quality scaling relations for red giant branch stars, the best of which are shown to be approximately as accurate as grid-based modeling with typical uncertainties of 15\%.

	abstract = {Studies of stars and stellar populations, and the discovery and characterization of exoplanets, are being revolutionized by new satellite and telescope observations of unprecedented quality and scope. Some of the most significant advances have been in the field of asteroseismology, the study of stars by observation of their oscillations. Asteroseismic Data Analysis gives a comprehensive technical introduction to this discipline. This book not only helps students and researchers learn about asteroseismology; it also serves as an essential instruction manual for those entering the field.The book presents readers with the foundational techniques used in the analysis and interpretation of asteroseismic data on cool stars that show solar-like oscillations. The techniques have been refined, and in some cases developed, to analyze asteroseismic data collected by the {NASA} Kepler mission. Topics range from the analysis of time-series observations to extract seismic data for stars to the use of those data to determine global and internal properties of the stars. Reading lists and problem sets are provided, and data necessary for the problem sets are available online.The first book to describe in detail the different techniques used to analyze the data on stellar oscillations, Asteroseismic Data Analysis offers an invaluable window into the hearts of stars.Introduces the asteroseismic study of stars and the theory of stellar {oscillationsDescribes} the analysis of observational (time-domain) {dataExamines} how seismic parameters are extracted from {observationsExplores} how stellar properties are determined from seismic {dataLooks} at the “inverse problem,” where frequencies are used to infer internal structures of stars},

This method allows us to variationally integrate out the input variables of the Gaussian process and compute a lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood of the nonlinear latent variable model. The maximization of the variational lower bound provides a Bayesian training procedure that is robust to overﬁtting and can automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. We demonstrate our method on real world datasets. The focus in this paper is on dimensionality reduction problems, but the methodology is more general. For example, our algorithm is immediately applicable for training Gaussian process models in the presence of missing or uncertain inputs.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early red-giant star {KIC} 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the dipole mixed modes obtained from \{{\textbackslash}it Kepler\} observations. In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of \${\textbackslash}Delta r=0.001R\$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of about \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}Omega\_c/2{\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}rangle=748{\textbackslash}pm18\${\textasciitilde}{nHz} and provide evidence for an angular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of the hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning shell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}Omega\_s/2{\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash}rangle=68{\textbackslash}pm22\${\textasciitilde}{nHz}. Hence, the core in {KIC}{\textasciitilde}4448777 is rotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope. We conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

	abstract = {The preparation of science objectives of the {ESA}'s {PLATO} space mission will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves. We developed a light-curve simulator named the {PLATO} Solar-like Light-curve Simulator ({PSLS}) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical {PLATO} targets, i.e. showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, {PSLS} also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the {PLATO} multi-telescope concept. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for {PLATO}. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases. These corrected light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in {PSLS}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below 20muHz and are found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by Kepler on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations. {PSLS} reproduces the main properties of expected {PLATO} light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the {PLATO} cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the {PLATO} mission.},

	abstract = {The internal rotation of post-main sequence stars is investigated, in response to the convective pumping of angular momentum toward the stellar core, combined with a tight magnetic coupling between core and envelope. The spin evolution is calculated using model stars of initial mass 1, 1.5, and 5 \{M\}⊙ , taking into account mass loss on the giant branches. We also include the deposition of orbital angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion, as influenced by tidal drag along with the excitation of orbital eccentricity by a fluctuating gravitational quadrupole moment. A range of angular velocity profiles \{\{Ω \}\}(r) is considered in the envelope, extending from solid rotation to constant specific angular momentum. We focus on the backreaction of the Coriolis force, and the threshold for dynamo action in the inner envelope. Quantitative agreement with measurements of core rotation in subgiants and post-He core flash stars by Kepler is obtained with a two-layer angular velocity profile: uniform specific angular momentum where the Coriolis parameter \{Co\}{\textbackslash}equiv \{\{Ω \}\}\{τ \}\{con\}≲ 1 (here \{τ \}\{con\} is the convective time), and \{\{Ω \}\}(r){\textbackslash}propto \{r\}-1 where \{Co\}≳ 1. The inner profile is interpreted in terms of a balance between the Coriolis force and angular pressure gradients driven by radially extended convective plumes. Inward angular momentum pumping reduces the surface rotation of subgiants, and the need for a rejuvenated magnetic wind torque. The co-evolution of internal magnetic fields and rotation is considered in Kissin \& Thompson, along with the breaking of the rotational coupling between core and envelope due to heavy mass loss.},

	abstract = {While magnetic fields have long been considered to be important for the evolution of magnetic non-degenerate stars and compact stars, it has become clear in recent years that actually all of the stars are deeply affected. This is particularly true regarding their internal angular momentum distribution, but magnetic fields may also influence internal mixing processes and even the fate of the star. We propose a new framework for stellar evolution simulations, in which the interplay between magnetic field, rotation, mass loss, and changes in the stellar density and temperature distributions are treated self-consistently. For average large-scale stellar magnetic fields which are symmetric to the axis of rotation of the star, we derive 1D evolution equations for the toroidal and poloidal components from the mean-field {MHD} equation by applying Alfven's theorem, and a conservative form of the angular momentum transfer due to the Lorentz force is formulated. We implement our formalism into a numerical stellar evolution code and simulate the magneto-rotational evolution of 1.5 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ stars. The Lorentz force aided by the \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ effect imposes torsional Alfven waves propagating through the magnetized medium, leading to near-rigid rotation within the Alfven timescale. Our models with different initial spins and B-fields can reproduce the main observed properties of Ap/Bp stars. Calculations continued to the red-giant regime show a pronounced core-envelope coupling, which reproduces the core and surface rotation periods determined by asteroseismic observations.},

	abstract = {Methods. A semi-analytical excitation model was used to estimate the angular momentum wave ﬂux. The characteristic timescale associated with the angular momentum transport by {IGW} was computed and compared to the contraction timescale throughout the radiative region of stellar models at diﬀerent evolutionary stages.
Results. We show that {IGW} can eﬃciently counteract the contraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of the radial-diﬀerential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of the radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on the evolutionary stage and is comparable to the diﬀerential rotation rates inferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such an agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation mechanism driven by {IGW}. This result is obtained under the assumption of a smooth rotation proﬁle in the radiative region and holds true even if a wide range of values is considered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red giant branch, we ﬁnd that {IGW} remain insuﬃcient, on their own, to explain the observations because of an excessive radiative damping.
Conclusions. {IGW} generated by penetrative convection are able to eﬃciently extract angular momentum from the core of stars on the subgiant branch and accordingly have to be taken into account. Moreover, agreements with the observations reinforce the idea that their eﬀect is essential to regulate the amplitude of the radial-diﬀerential rotation in subgiant stars. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism must likely be invoked.},

	abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function ({ACF}) of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.},

The inferred rotation rates are 10–30 days for the ≈0.2 M He degenerate cores on the {RGB} and 30–100 days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf ({WD}) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic ﬁelds in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler–Spruit dynamo). We ﬁnd that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the {RGB} and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early {RGB} of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling {WD} phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic pulsation code, {ADIPLS}, to explicitly highlight this shortfall when applied to a speciﬁc Kepler asteroseismic target, {KIC}8366239.},

	abstract = {The detection of mixed modes in subgiants and red giants by the {CoRoT} and {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} space-borne missions allows us to investigate the internal structure of evolved low-mass stars. In particular, the measurement of the mean core rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraints on the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistribution in stars. It showed that the current stellar evolution codes including the modelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. An additional physical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core is thus necessary. Our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. To this end, we developed a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both the mean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. In this article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismic observations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer is obtained. This is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at three evolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed by {CoRoT} and Kepler. We show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regions of subgiants and red giants. However, this transport of angular momentum from the core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction in subgiants and early red giants. In contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixed modes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the core contraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. Our results thus indicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observed spin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is to be invoked for subgiants and early red giants.},

For this work we developed a modified spectroscopic pipeline which solves for starspot filling fraction and starspot temperature contrast. We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80\%) can be identified from Gaia {DR}3 and {APOGEE} criteria -- important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real starspot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.008 and 0.003\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.002 for main sequence {GK} stars and evolved red giants respectively, confirming that the technique does not produce spurious spot signals in inactive stars. Starspots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn timescales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109\${\textbackslash}pm\$11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut \& Mamajek empirical scale. Starspot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn timescale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full {APOGEE} catalog, with broad applications to stellar, galactic, and exoplanetary astrophysics.},

The results indicate that that there is indeed an age-metallicity relation present in the thick disk. By dividing the stellar sample into sub-groups, separated by 0.1 dex in metallicity, we show that the median age decreases by about 5–7 Gyr when going from [Fe/H] ≈ −0.8 to [Fe/H] ≈ −0.1. Combining our results with our newly published α-element trends for a local sample of thick disk stars that show signatures from supernovae type Ia ({SN} Ia), we draw the conclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the {SN} Ia rate is of the order of 3–4 Gyr in the thick disk. The tentative evidence for a thick disk {AMR} that we present here also has implications for the thick disk formation scenario; star-formation must have been an ongoing process for several billion years. This appears to strengthen the hypothesis that the thick disk originated from a merger event with a companion galaxy that puﬀed up a pre-existing thin disk.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many {MCMC} methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, {HMC}'s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler ({NUTS}), an extension to {HMC} that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. {NUTS} uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, {NUTS} perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard {HMC} method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. {NUTS} can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. {NUTS} is also suitable for applications such as {BUGS}-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented to compute age estimates from theoretical isochrones using temperature, luminosity and metallicity data for individual stars. Based on Bayesian probability theory, this method avoids the systematic biases affecting simpler strategies and provides reliable estimates of the age probability distribution function for late-type dwarfs. Basic assumptions concerning the a priori parameter distribution suitable for the solar neighbourhood are combined with the likelihood assigned to the observed data to yield the complete posterior age probability. This method is especially relevant for G dwarfs in the 3–15 Gyr range of ages, crucial to the study of the chemical and dynamical history of the Galaxy. In many cases, it yields markedly different results from the traditional approach of reading the derived age from the isochrone nearest to the data point. We show that the strongest process affecting the traditional approach is that of strongly favouring computed ages near the end-of-main-sequence lifetime. The Bayesian method compensates for this potential bias and generally assigns much higher probabilities to lower main-sequence ages, compared with short-lived evolved stages. This has a strong influence on any application to galactic studies, especially given the present uncertainties on the absolute temperature scale of the stellar evolution models. In particular, the known mismatch between the model predictions and the observations for moderately metal-poor dwarfs (−1 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; −0.3) has a dramatic effect on the traditional age determination.We apply our method to the classic sample of Edvardsson et al., who derived the age–metallicity relation ({AMR}) of 189 field dwarfs with precisely determined abundances. We show how much of the observed scatter in the {AMR} is caused by the interplay between the systematic biases affecting the traditional age determination, the colour mismatch with the evolution models and the presence of undetected binaries. Using new parallax, temperature and metallicity data, our age determination for the same sample indicates that the intrinsic dispersion in the {AMR} is at most 0.15 dex and probably lower. In particular, we show that old, metal-rich objects ([Fe/H]∼ 0.0 dex, age \&gt; 5 Gyr) and young, metal-poor objects ([Fe/H] \&lt; −0.5 dex, age \&lt; 6 Gyr) in many observed {AMR} plots are artefacts caused by too simple a treatment of the age determination. The incompatibility of those {AMR} plots with a well-mixed interstellar medium may therefore only be apparent. Incidentally, our results tend to restore confidence in the method of age determination from the chromospheric activity for field dwarfs.},

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric ﬂuxes set a systematic uncertainty ﬂoor of ≈2.4\% in temperature, ≈2.0\% in luminosity, and ≈4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order ≈5\% in mass and ≈20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

It thus provides us with a great opportunity to study the properties of solar twins, as well as the evolution of Sun-like stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Previous spectroscopic studies of M 67 reported possible subtle changes in stellar surface abundances throughout the stellar evolutionary phase, namely the effect of atomic diffusion. In this study we attempt to confirm and quantify more precisely the effect of atomic diffusion, and to explore the level of chemical (in)homogeneity in M 67.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We presented a strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two groups of stars in M 67: three turn-off stars and three subgiants. Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained with very high precision using the Keck/{HIRES} spectra.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The subgiants in our sample show negligible abundance variations (≤0.02 dex), which implies that M 67 was born chemically homogeneous. We note that there is a significant abundance difference ({\textasciitilde}0.1–0.2 dex) between subgiants and turn-off stars, which can be interpreted as the signature of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models with diffusion agree with the observed abundance results. Some turn-off stars do not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases diffusion can be inhibited, or they might have undergone some sort of mixing event related to planets.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our results pose additional challenges for chemical tagging when using turn-off stars. In particular, the effects of atomic diffusion, which could be as large as 0.1–0.2 dex, must be taken into account in order for chemical tagging to be successfully applied.},

The sample contains stars spanning a wide range of evolutionary phases, from G dwarfs to red clump stars. The abundances were derived from near-{IR} (λ1.5–1.7 μm) high-resolution spectra (R = 22,500) from the {SDSS}-{IV}/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment ({APOGEE}) survey. A 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis was carried out using the {APOGEE} synthetic spectral libraries, via χ2 minimization of the synthetic and observed spectra with the {qASPCAP} code. We found significant abundance differences (∼0.05–0.30 dex) between the M67 member stars as a function of the stellar mass (or position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram), where the abundance patterns exhibit a general depletion (in [X/H]) in stars at the main-sequence turnoff. The amount of the depletion is different for different elements. We find that atomic diffusion models provide, in general, good agreement with the abundance trends for most chemical species, supporting recent studies indicating that measurable atomic diffusion operates in M67 stars.},

	abstract = {Detailed chemical abundance distributions for 14 elements are derived for eight high-probability stellar members of the solar metallicity old open cluster M67 with an age of ∼4 Gyr. The eight stars consist of four pairs, with each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar evolution: two G dwarfs, two turnoff stars, two G subgiants, and two red clump ({RC}) K giants. The abundance analysis uses near-{IR} high-resolution spectra (λ1.5–1.7 μm) from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey and derives abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for 2M08510076+1153115 suggest that this star is a solar twin, exhibiting abundance differences relative to the Sun of ≤0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical homogeneity is found within each class of stars (∼0.02 dex), while significant abundance variations (∼0.05–0.20 dex) are found across the different evolutionary phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest abundances, while the {RCs} tend to have the largest. Non-{LTE} corrections to the {LTE}-derived abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. A detailed comparison of the derived Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca abundances with recently published surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical diffusion provides a good match between the observed and predicted abundances as a function of stellar mass. Such agreement would indicate the detection of chemical diffusion processes in the stellar members of M67.},

It remains unclear whether this reflects observational uncertainties or intrinsic astrophysical scatter arising from physical conditions in the interstellar medium at early times.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We measure differential chemical abundance ratios in extremely metal-poor stars to investigate the limits of precision and to understand whether cosmic scatter or observational errors are dominant.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We used high-resolution ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 95 000) and high signal-to-noise ({\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 700 at 5000 Å) {HIRES}/Keck spectra to determine high-precision differential abundances between two extremely metal-poor stars through a line-by-line differential approach. We determined stellar parameters for the star G64-37 with respect to the standard star G64-12. We performed {EW} measurements for the two stars for the lines recognized in both stars and performed spectral synthesis to study the carbon abundances.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The differential approach allowed us to obtain errors of {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) = 27 K, {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}(log {\textless}i{\textgreater}g{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) = 0.06 dex, {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}( [Fe/H] ) = 0.02 dex and {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}v{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}t{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) = 0.06 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. We estimated relative chemical abundances with a precision as low as {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}([X/Fe]) ≈ 0.01 dex. The small uncertainties demonstrate that there are genuine abundance differences larger than the measurement errors. The observed Li difference cannot be explained by the difference in mass because the less massive star has more Li. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}It is possible to achieve an abundance precision around ≈ 0.01−0.05 dex for extremely metal-poor stars, which opens new windows on the study of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.},

	abstract = {This review assesses the current state of knowledge of how the elements were produced in the Big Bang, in stellar lives and deaths, and by interactions in interstellar gas. We begin with statements of fact and discuss the evidence that convinced astronomers that the Sun is fusing hydrogen, that low-mass stars produce heavy elements through neutron capture, that massive stars can explode as supernovae and that supernovae of all types produce new elements. Nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang, through cosmic ray spallation, and in exploding white dwarfs is only ranked below the above facts in certainty because the evidence, while overwhelming, is so far circumstantial. Next, we highlight the flaws in our current understanding of the predictions for lithium production in the Big Bang and/or its destruction in stars and for the production of the elements with atomic number 
Z∼45
Z∼45
. While the theory that neutron star mergers produce elements through neutron-capture has powerful circumstantial evidence, we are unconvinced that they produce all of the elements past nickel. Also in dispute is the exact mechanism or mechanisms that cause the white dwarfs to explode. It is difficult to determine the origin of rare isotopes because signatures of their production are weak. We are uncertain about the production sites of some lithium and nitrogen isotopes and proton-rich heavy nuclei. Finally, Betelgeuse is probably not the next star to become a supernovae in the Milky Way, in part because Betelgeuse may collapse directly to a black hole instead. The accumulated evidence in this review shows that we understand the major production sites for the elements, but islands of uncertainty in the periodic table exist. Resolving these uncertainties requires in particular understanding explosive events with compact objects and understanding the nature of the first stars and is therefore primed for new discoveries in the next decades.

	abstract = {In the last 15 years different ground-based spectroscopic surveys have been started (and completed) with the general aim of delivering stellar parameters and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic stars, complementing Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-{ESO} Public Spectroscopic Survey ({GES}), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target 100,000 stars using {FLAMES} on the {ESO} {VLT} (both Giraffe and {UVES} spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on open star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.) reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data reduction, organisation, and workflow. The {GES} has determined homogeneous good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of its more than 110,000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived for up to 31 elements for targets observed with {UVES}. Lithium abundances are delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been addressed by the Gaia-{ESO} consortium and the community, with many highlight results achieved. The final catalogue has been released through the {ESO} archive at the end of May 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products. In addition to these results, the Gaia-{ESO} Survey will leave a very important legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.},

	abstract = {Stellar evolution computations provide the foundation of several methods applied to study the evolutionary properties of stars and stellar populations, both Galactic and extragalactic. The accuracy of the results obtained with these techniques is linked to the accuracy of the stellar models, and in this context the correct treatment of the transport of chemical elements is crucial. Unfortunately, in many respects calculations of the evolution of the chemical abundance profiles in stars are still affected by sometimes sizable uncertainties. Here, we review the various mechanisms of element transport included in the current generation of stellar evolution calculations, how they are implemented, the free parameters and uncertainties involved, the impact on the models and the observational constraints.},

	abstract = {We compare the properties of recent samples of the lithium abundances in halo stars to one another and to the predictions of theoretical models including rotational mixing, and we examine the data for trends with metal abundance. We apply two statistical tests to the data: a Kolomorgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test sensitive to the behavior around the sample median, and Monte Carlo tests of the probability to draw the observed number of outliers from the theoretical distributions. We find from a K-S test that in the absence of any correction for chemical evolution, the Ryan, Norris, \& Beers ({RNB}) sample is fully consistent with mild rotational mixing induced depletion and, therefore, with an initial lithium abundance higher than the observed value. Tests for outliers depend sensitively on the threshold for defining their presence, but we find a 10\%-45\% probability that the {RNB} sample is drawn from the rotationally mixed models with a 0.2 dex median depletion with lower probabilities corresponding to higher depletion factors. Including or excluding the one upper limit in the sample changes the absolute probabilities but does not affect the overall conclusions. When chemical evolution trends (Li/H vs. Fe/H) are included in our analysis we find that the dispersion in the {RNB} sample is not explained by chemical evolution; the inferred bounds on lithium depletion from rotational mixing are similar to those derived from models without chemical evolution. Finally, we explore the differences between the {RNB} sample and other halo star data sets. We find that differences in the equivalent width measurements are primarily responsible for different observational conclusions concerning the lithium dispersion in halo stars. The different data sets are all consistent with mild stellar depletion, but the systematic errors arising from different observational data sets are a major component of the error budget and need to be addressed. The implications for cosmology are discussed. We find that the standard big bang nucleosynthesis predicted lithium abundance that corresponds to the deuterium abundance inferred from observations of high-redshift, low-metallicity {QSO} absorbers requires halo star lithium depletion in an amount consistent with that from our models of rotational mixing but inconsistent with no depletion.},

	abstract = {Main-sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star’s photometry and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging in age from 50 to 350 Myr, how broadband {UBV} color–color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This {UBV} color–color analysis also directly measures a cluster’s E(B − V) and estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on parallaxes from Gaia data release 2 find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older ({\textgreater}100 Myr) clusters, such as the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method find that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within ∼10\% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30\%–80\% younger. This illustrates the importance of rotation in deriving ages in the youngest ({\textless}100 Myr) clusters.},

Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated.

This concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed mass during the pre-{MS}. These spots decrease the luminosity and Teff of stars, leading to a displacement on the {HR} diagram. This displacement causes isochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can lead to the spurious appearance of an age spread in a co-eval population.},

It is shown that the average rotational velocity is higher among those with Ca ii emission than among those without. Since there is strong evidence that stars with Ca ii emission are younger, on the average, than most solar-type stars, a picture is advanced in which rotation declines with advancing age. It is proposed that magnetically coupled winds, similar to the solar wind, are responsible for this deceleration even after a star takes up residence on the main sequence. The winds are presumably generated only in stars which have subsurface hydrogen convection zones and concomitant chromospheres. Estimates of rotational velocity among solar-type stars in the Hyades and Pleiades are given which confirm this general picture. It is shown that the mean rotation in the Pleiades is highest of all groups considered and averages about 40 km/sec for stars of mass 1.20 o. The time scale for reduction by a factor of 2 of the rotational velocities of Pleiades stars is equal to the age of the Hyades, about 4 X 108 years.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for the evolution of gas phase metallicity gradients in galaxies from ﬁrst principles. We show that metallicity gradients depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration time-scale, production, transport, consumption, and loss. Our model ﬁnds that most galaxy metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts. When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations. We also predict the evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both matched stellar masses and matched abundances. Our model shows that massive galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence. Lastly, we show that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be in equilibrium. In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are at the heart of the observed stellar activity in late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the interface layer between the radiative and the convective stellar regions. Since dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the {ATON} 2.3 stellar code allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable mathematical and numerical challenges involved. As examples, we present theoretical estimates for both the local (tau\_c) and global (tau\_g) convective turnover times for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment. Those estimates, this quantities can be used to calculate the Rossby number, Ro, which is related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity. More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against observations. Our theoretical values of tau\_c, tau\_g and Ro qualitatively agree with those published by Kim \& Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection efficiency, tau\_g decreases for a given mass. {FST} models show still lower values. The presence of rotation shifts tau\_g towards slightly higher values when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions in the models yields values of tau\_g smaller than in the gray approximation.},

	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic study at high resolution, R{\textasciitilde}50,000, of 14 stars located on the main sequence, at the turn-off point and on the early subgiant branch in the cluster M67 in order to investigate its detailed chemical composition, for comparison with the Sun and solar twins in the solar neighbourhood, and to explore selective atomic diffusion of chemical elements as predicted by stellar-structure theory. We have obtained {VLT}/{FLAMES}-{UVES} spectra and analysed these strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance similarities and differences between the M67 stars and the Sun, and among the M67 stars themselves. Individual abundances of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. An exception is Li which shows a considerable scatter among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star abundances to be depleted relative to the abundances in the field stars in correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a tendency earlier found also for the Sun. The results support the hypothesis that the gas of the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was once formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor reductions of heavy elements in the atmospheres of the dwarfs and turn-off point stars relative to our standard star M67-1194 and the subgiants seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars, although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M67 is estimated to be [Fe/H]=+0.06.},

A natural consequence of orbital migration is for a series of planets to be accreted, destroyed, and then thoroughly mixed into the convective envelope of the central star. We study the ramiﬁcations of planet accretion for the ﬁnal main-sequence metallicity of the star. If maximum disk lifetimes are on the order of ∼ 10 Myr, stars with masses near 1.0 M, are predicted to have virtually no metallicity enhancement. On the other hand, early F- and late A-type stars with masses M∗ ≈ 1.5–2.0 M, can experience signiﬁcant metallicity enhancements due to their considerably smaller convection zones during the ﬁrst 10 Myr of pre–main-sequence evolution. We show that the metallicities of an aggregate of unevolved F stars are consistent with an average star accreting ∼ 2 Jupiter-mass planets from a protoplanetary disk having a 10 Myr dispersal time.},

	abstract = {Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of {AFGKM} stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand {iSpec}, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and executing a careful spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before trusting their own results or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.},

We also investigated the possibility of ﬁnding the known clusters in the {APOGEE} {DR}16 red clump sample with 18 chemical species. For both purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space.
Results. Even if the internal coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap in the chemical signatures of the clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and no ﬁeld stars, we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40\% threshold of homogeneity and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use clusters with 7 or more members. In the {APOGEE} sample, ﬁeld stars are present along with four populated clusters. In this case, only one of the open clusters was moderately recovered.
Conclusions. In our best-case scenario, more than 70\% of the groups of stars are in fact statistical groups that contain stars belonging to diﬀerent real clusters. This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters dissolved in the ﬁeld are slim, even with the most advanced clustering techniques. We show that diﬀerent stellar birth sites can have overlapping chemical signatures, even when high-resolution abundances of many diﬀerent nucleosynthesis channels are used. This is substantial evidence against the possibility of strong chemical tagging. However, we can hope to recover some particular birth clusters that stand out at the edges of the chemical distribution.},

These anomalies provide evidence for an evolving front of shear-enhanced activity affecting the magnetic and rotational evolution of cool stars and the high-energy environments of their planetary companions for hundreds of millions to billions of years on the main sequence.},

This also influences the information that we derive through spectroscopic analysis. In this study, we analyze high-resolution spectra of 211 sunlike stars observed at different phases of their activity cycles, in order to investigate how stellar activity affects the spectroscopic determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances. We observe that the equivalent widths of lines can increase as a function of the activity index log R during the stellar cycle, which also produces an artificial growth of the stellar microturbulence and a decrease in effective temperature and metallicity. This effect is visible for stars with activity indexes log R (i.e., younger than 4–5 Gyr), and it is more significant at higher activity levels. These results have fundamental implications on several topics in astrophysics that are discussed in the paper, including stellar nucleosynthesis, chemical tagging, the study of Galactic chemical evolution, chemically anomalous stars, the structure of the Milky Way disk, stellar formation rates, photoevaporation of circumstellar disks, and planet hunting.},

We measured spectroscopic effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities for most stars in the sample with {SME} and {MOOG}. Our stellar property results are consistent with the photometric effective temperatures from the Gaia {DR}2 pipeline. We also measured their chromospheric S and indices to classify the stars as active or inactive and study the connection between chromospheric activity and starspots. We then inferred the starspot covering fractions on the active stars by modeling their spectra as a linear combination of hot and cool inactive stellar spectral templates. We find that it is critical to use precise colors of the stars to place stringent priors on the plausible spot covering fractions. The inferred spot covering fractions generally increase with the chromospheric activity indicator , though we are largely insensitive to spot coverages smaller than {fS} ≲ 20\%. We find a dearth of stars with small and significant spot coverages.},

	abstract = {{SDSS}-{IV} {APOGEE}-2, {GALAH} and Gaia-{ESO} are high resolution, ground-based, multi-object spectroscopic surveys providing fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters and multiple elemental abundance ratios for hundreds of thousands of stars of the Milky Way. We undertake a comparison between the most recent data releases of these surveys to investigate the accuracy and precision of derived parameters by placing the abundances on an absolute scale. We discuss the correlations in parameter and abundance differences as a function of main parameters. Uncovering the variants provides a basis to on-going efforts of future sky surveys. Quality samples from the {APOGEE}-{GALAH}, {APOGEE}-{GES} and {GALAH}-{GES} overlapping catalogs are collected. We investigate the mean variants between the surveys, and linear trends are also investigated. We compare the slope of correlations and mean differences with the reported uncertainties. The average and scatter of vrad, Teff, log g, [M/H] and vmicro, along with numerous species of elemental abundances in the combined catalogs show that in general there is a good agreement between the surveys. We find large radial velocity scatters ranging from 1.3 km/s to 4.4 km/s when comparing the three surveys. We observe weak trends: e.g. in \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Teff vs. \${\textbackslash}Delta\$log g for the {APOGEE}-{GES} stars, and a clear correlation in the vmicro-\${\textbackslash}Delta\$vmicro planes in the {APOGEE}-{GALAH} common sample. For [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/H], [Ti/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} giants) and [Al/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} dwarfs) potential strong correlations are discovered as a function of the differences in the main atmospheric parameters, and we find weak trends for other elements. In general we find good agreement between the three surveys within their respective uncertainties. However, there are certain regimes in which strong variants exist, which we discuss. There are still offsets larger than 0.1 dex in the absolute abundance scales.},

	abstract = {Methods. Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and medium-strong spectral lines using {MARCS} model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Non-{LTE} eﬀects are considered and taken into account for some of the elements. In addition, precise (σ 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log g – Teﬀ diagram.
Results. It is conﬁrmed that the ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same [X/Fe]-{TC} distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the relation between [X/Fe] and {TC} is not well deﬁned. For several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between [X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to ∼0.20 dex over an age interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between [Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are not well correlated with stellar age, but deﬁne a tight Ni–Na relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by ∼0.15 dex.
Conclusions. The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]– [Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-{TC} relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {The period versus mass diagrams (i.e., rotational sequences) of open clusters provide crucial constraints for angular momentum evolution studies. However, their memberships are often heavily contaminated by ﬁeld stars, which could potentially bias the interpretations. In this paper, we use data from Gaia {DR}2 to reassess the memberships of seven open clusters with ground- and space-based rotational data, and present an updated view of stellar rotation as a function of mass and age. We use the Gaia astrometry to identify the cluster members in phase space, and the photometry to derive revised ages and place the stars on a consistent mass scale. Applying our membership analysis to the rotational sequences reveals that: (1) the contamination in clusters observed from the ground can reach up to ∼35\%; (2) the overall fraction of rotational outliers decreases substantially when the ﬁeld contaminants are removed, but some outliers persist; (3) there is a sharp upper edge in the rotation periods at young ages; (4) at young ages, stars in the 1.0–0.6Me range inhabit a global maximum of rotation periods, potentially providing an optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a strongly mass-dependent spindown process. In the regime where rapid rotators are leaving the saturated domain, the rotational distributions broaden (in contradiction with popular models), which we interpret as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as those obtained from space.},

	abstract = {We combine stellar surface rotation periods determined from {NASA}'s Kepler mission with spectroscopic temperatures to demonstrate the existence of pileups at the long-period and short-period edges of the temperature-period distribution for main-sequence stars with temperatures exceeding \${\textbackslash}sim 5500\$K. The long-period pileup is well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, with a critical value of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ro\_\{crit\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 2\$. The long-period pileup was predicted by van Saders et al. (2019) as a consequence of weakened magnetic braking, in which wind-driven angular momentum losses cease once stars reach a critical Rossby number. Stars in the long-period pileup are found to have a wide range of ages (\${\textbackslash}sim 2-6\$Gyr), meaning that, along the pileup, rotation period is strongly predictive of a star's surface temperature but weakly predictive of its age. The short-period pileup, which is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, is not a prediction of the weakened magnetic braking hypothesis but may instead be related to a phase of slowed surface spin-down due to core-envelope coupling. The same mechanism was proposed by Curtis et al. (2020) to explain the overlapping rotation sequences of low-mass members of differently aged open clusters. The relative dearth of stars with intermediate rotation periods between the short- and long-period pileups is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, which aligns with the period gap initially discovered by {McQuillan} et al. (2013a) in M-type stars. These observations provide further support for the hypothesis that the period gap is due to stellar astrophysics, rather than a non-uniform star-formation history in the Kepler field.},

We examine the case of solar-twins as well as thousands of synthetic time-series of solar-like stars rotating faster than the Sun. In the case of solar twins we assume that the Gaia unfiltered photometric passband G will mimic the variability of the total solar irradiance ({TSI}) as measured by the {VIRGO} experiment. For stars rotating faster than the Sun, light-curves are simulated using synthetic spectra for the quiet atmosphere, the spots, and the faculae combined by applying semi-empirical relationships relating the level of photospheric magnetic activity to the stellar rotation and the Gaia instrumental response. The capabilities of the Deeming, Lomb-Scargle, and Phase Dispersion Minimisation methods in recovering the correct rotation periods are tested and compared. The false alarm probability ({FAP}) is computed using Monte Carlo simulations and compared with analytical formulae. The Gaia scanning law makes the rate of correct detection of rotation periods strongly dependent on the ecliptic latitude (beta). We find that for P {\textasciitilde} 1 d, the rate of correct detection increases with ecliptic latitude from 20-30 per cent at beta {\textasciitilde} 0\{{\textbackslash}deg\} to a peak of 70 per cent at beta=45\{{\textbackslash}deg\}, then it abruptly falls below 10 per cent at beta {\textgreater} 45\{{\textbackslash}deg\}.

	abstract = {Context. Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to probe the internal rotation profile of low-mass ({\textasciitilde}1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and red giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation, the core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main sequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than observed. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking place in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature of the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar interiors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational coupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the magnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular momentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree of internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a dependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial rotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data is obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the ratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the convective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent {\textasciitilde}3. This scaling is consistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions. We show that an angular momentum transport process whose efficiency varies during the stellar evolution through a dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required to explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismology allows us to probe stellar interiors. Mixed modes can be used to probe the physical conditions in red giant cores. However, we still need to identify the physical mechanisms that transport angular momentum inside red giants, leading to the slow-down observed for the red giant core rotation. Thus large-scale measurements of the red giant core rotation are of prime importance to obtain tighter constraints on the efficiency of the internal angular momentum transport, and to study how this efficiency changes with stellar parameters. This work aims at identifying the components of the rotational multiplets for dipole mixed modes in a large number of red giant oscillation spectra observed by Kepler. Such identification provides us with a direct measurement of the red giant mean core rotation. We compute stretched spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed modes with same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants. We obtained mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow down, our results suggest rotation to be constant along the red giant branch, with values independent on the mass.},

Ensemble asteroseismology, namely the examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of their evolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We have measured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have also shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under the assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, we observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump stars compared to the red giant branch. We also show that, at fixed stellar radius, the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Ensemble asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: our interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusion that the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giant phase. The slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. This spinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured in white dwarfs.},

The number of low-mass moderate (5–10 km s−1) rotators in our sample gives a lower limit of 7\% for the rate at which low-mass stars interact on the upper red giant branch because single stars in this mass range are expected to rotate slowly.

	abstract = {The years-long high-precision photometric data observed by Kepler satellite combining with huge amount of spectra observed by {LAMOST} provide a great opportunity to study the relations between surface rotation and lithium abundance of li-rich giants. In this study, we cross match the Kepler data with li-rich giants catalog from {LAMOST}, and obtain 619 common sources. Then we measure 36 rotation periods from the full set of 295 li-rich giants with good data quality which consists of two sub-samples. The rotation periods of 14 stars was extracted from 205 stars with evolutionary stages determined using asteroseismology, including 11 core helium-burning stars ({HeBs}), 2 red giant branch stars ({RGBs}), and 1 unclassified star. All the super lithium-rich giant stars (A(Li){\textgreater}3.3   dex) are {HeBs} in our sample. The remaining 90 giants do not have evolutionary stages confirmed, and in this sub-sample, 22 giants have their rotation period measured. The rotation detection rate of the former sub-sample is 6.8\%, which is significantly higher than the detection rate of a large giant sample in previous studies (2.08\%). With the surface rotation period measured, we confirm the relation between stellar rotation and lithium enrichment of giants. Meanwhile, we find that the less Li-enriched stars have a relatively dispersed distribution of rotation periods, and the giants with a high Li enrichment is concentrated on the rapidly rotating area, which is consistent with earlier studies. The present work also shows a jump at A(Li)≈3.3   dex in the relation between rotation period and Li abundance that coincidently is the boundary between Li-rich giants and super Li-rich giants which may indicate the different mechanisms. The rotation periods of super Li-rich giants become shorter as the lithium enrichment increases. This correlation provides an evidence for the rotational induced extra-mixing mechanism responsible for Li enrichment of giants.},

	abstract = {Kepler allows the measurement of starspot variability in a large sample of ﬁeld red giants for the ﬁrst time. With a new method that combines autocorrelation and wavelet decomposition, we measure 361 rotation periods from the full set of 17 377 oscillating red giants in our sample. This represents 2.08\% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected rapidly rotating giants in the ﬁeld. The remaining stars do not show enough variability to allow us to measure a reliable surface rotation period. Because the stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can infer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively evaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of mass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881 intermediate-mass stars, M {\textgreater} 2.0 M from our full red giant sample, we do not ﬁnd the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum conservation. We therefore suggest that either enhanced angular momentum loss or radial diﬀerential rotation must be occurring in these stars. Finally, when we examine the 575 low-mass (M {\textless} 1.1 M ) red clump stars in our sample, which were expected to exhibit slow (non-detectable) rotation, 15\% of them actually have detectable rotation. This suggests a high rate of interactions and stellar mergers on the red giant branch.},

	abstract = {Recent measurements of rotation periods () in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), {NGC} 6811 (1 Gyr), and {NGC} 752 (1.4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass–period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the K2 mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7 Gyr old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the Kepler data for the approximately coeval cluster {NGC} 6819 (30 stars with M⋆ {\textgreater} 0.85 ), our new measurements more than double the number of ≈2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to ≈0.55 . The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 ± 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the Kepler intermediate-period gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which stars resume spinning down and find that 0.55 stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core–envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out.},

	abstract = {Stellar surface rotation carries information about stellar parameters---particularly ages---and thus the large rotational datasets extracted from Kepler timeseries represent powerful probes of stellar populations. In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such datasets with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias and confusion to predict the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard "vanilla" assumptions. We arrive at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and observational uncertainties. By assuming that the amplitude and thus detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number, we show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent "Rossby edge" at \${\textbackslash}textrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\} = 2.08\$, above which long-period, high-Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This \${\textbackslash}textrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\}\$ is comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed the onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified braking is in operation in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity at a very similar Rossby number. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing scenarios. (abridged)},

Having knowledge about the dominant source of surface activity might allow us to draw conclusions about the stellar age and magnetic field topology, and to put the solar cycle in context.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We investigate the underlying process that causes magnetic activity by studying the appearance of activity signatures in contemporaneous photometric and chromospheric time series.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used to search for cycle periods present in the photometric and chromospheric time series. To emphasize the signature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both data sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing season. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the phase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time series simultaneously using the same cycle period.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find cycle periods in 27 of the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series reveals that the variability in fast-rotating active stars is usually in anti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in phase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the active stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active stars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less-active stars are dominated by bright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination to be at the Vaughan–Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We conclude that faculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages ≳2.55 Gyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan–Preston gap cannot explain the previously detected dearth of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} rotation periods between 15 and 25 days. Nevertheless, our results led us to propose an explanation for the lack of rotation periods to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the cancelation of dark spots and bright faculae at ∼800 Myr.},

We find spot-modulated periods (P) for {\textasciitilde}90\% of members. The range of light curve and periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multi-period stars may be an indication of different noise characteristics of {TESS}, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of M star rotation rates. About 13\% of the stars have an infrared ({IR}) excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P{\textasciitilde}2 days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P{\textasciitilde}2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation rates of stars in {UCL}/{LCC} has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the timescale on which the star responds to unlocking.},

	abstract = {The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature–period diagram at ∼20 days for G dwarfs and up to ∼30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textgreater}10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the {ZTF} archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26\%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with {MEarth}, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G {BP} − G {RP} ∼ 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core–envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

	abstract = {Oscillating red-giant stars have provided a wealth of asteroseismic information regarding their interiors and evolutionary states, which enables detailed studies of the Milky Way. The objective of this work is to determine what fraction of red-giant stars shows photometric rotational modulation, and understand its origin. One of the underlying questions is the role of close binarity in this population, which relies on the fact that red giants in short-period binary systems (less than 150 days or so) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We selected a sample of about 4500 relatively bright red giants observed by Kepler, and show that about 370 of them (∼8\%) display rotational modulation. Almost all have oscillation amplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them are not oscillating at all. Of the 85 of these red giants with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up radial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of spectroscopic binarity. Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 nonoscillators are in this group of binaries. On the contrary, about 85\% of the active red giants with detectable oscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of the stellar masses and evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, we shed light on the origin of their activity. It appears that low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while intermediate-mass ones tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true for helium-core burning (red clump) stars, whereby the lower-mass clump stars are comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones are less active. In other words, we ﬁnd that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they evolve to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend observed with low-mass stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment or other merging events during the shell-burning phase. Regarding intermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods that we measured are long with respect to theoretical expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the existence of an unidentiﬁed sink of angular momentum after the main sequence. This article establishes strong links between rotational modulation, tidal interactions, (surface) magnetic ﬁelds, and oscillation suppression. There is a wealth of physics to be studied in these targets that is not available in the Sun.},

	abstract = {The rotational evolution of cool dwarfs is poorly constrained after ∼1–2 Gyr due to a lack of precise ages and rotation periods for old main-sequence stars. In this work, we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to reveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler dwarfs and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We ﬁnd that a linear gyrochronology model, calibrated to ﬁt the period–Teff relationship of the Praesepe cluster, does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late K dwarfs spin more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages, we ﬁnd that late K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same age. This result agrees qualitatively with semiempirical models that vary the rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the {NGC} 6811 cluster, which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch of inhibited evolution. We ﬁnd that the oldest Kepler stars with measured rotation periods are late K and early M dwarfs, indicating that these stars maintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive stars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we conﬁrm that many rapidly rotating {GKM} dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.},

	abstract = {Dark magnetic spots crossing the stellar disk lead to quasiperiodic brightness variations, which allow us to constrain stellar surface rotation and photometric activity. The current work is the second of this series, where we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 132,921 main-sequence F and G stars and late subgiant stars. Rotation-period candidates are obtained by combining wavelet analysis with autocorrelation function. Reliable rotation periods are then selected via a machine-learning ({ML}) algorithm, automatic selection, and complementary visual inspection. The {ML} training data set comprises 26,521 main-sequence K and M stars from Paper I. To supplement the training, we analyze in the same way as Paper I, i.e., automatic selection and visual inspection, 34,100 additional stars. We finally provide rotation periods P rot and associated photometric activity proxy S ph for 39,592 targets. Hotter stars are generally faster rotators than cooler stars. For main-sequence G stars, S ph spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature, while F stars tend to have smaller S ph values in comparison with cooler stars. Overall for G stars, fast rotators are photometrically more active than slow rotators, with S ph saturating at short periods. The combined outcome of the two papers accounts for average P rot and S ph values for 55,232 main-sequence and subgiant {FGKM} stars (out of 159,442 targets), with 24,182 new P rot detections in comparison with {McQuillan} et al. The upper edge of the P rot distribution is located at longer P rot than found previously.},

	abstract = {Studies using asteroseismic ages and rotation rates from star-spot rotation have indicated that standard age-rotation relations may break down roughly half-way through the main sequence lifetime, a phenomenon referred to as weakened magnetic braking. While rotation rates from spots can be difficult to determine for older, less active stars, rotational splitting of asteroseismic oscillation frequencies can provide rotation rates for both active and quiescent stars, and so can confirm whether this effect really takes place on the main sequence. We obtained asteroseismic rotation rates of 91 main sequence stars showing high signal-to-noise modes of oscillation. Using these new rotation rates, along with effective temperatures, metallicities and seismic masses and ages, we built a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to determine whether the ensemble more closely agreed with a standard rotational evolution scenario, or one where weakened magnetic braking takes place. The weakened magnetic braking scenario was found to be 98.4\% more likely for our stellar ensemble, adding to the growing body of evidence for this stage of stellar rotational evolution. This work represents the largest catalogue of seismic rotation on the main sequence to date, opening up possibilities for more detailed ensemble analysis of rotational evolution with Kepler.},

Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textgreater}10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}).

This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core–envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

Until now, the study of stellar shapes has only been possible with optical interferometry for a few of the fastest-rotating nearby stars. We report an asteroseismic measurement, with much better precision than interferometry, of the asphericity of an A-type star with a rotation period of 100 days. Using the fact that different modes of oscillation probe different stellar latitudes, we infer a tiny but significant flattening of the star’s shape of ΔR/R = (1.8 ± 0.6) × 10−6. For a stellar radius R that is 2.24 times the solar radius, the difference in radius between the equator and the poles is ΔR = 3 ± 1 km. Because the observed ΔR/R is only one-third of the expected rotational oblateness, we conjecture the presence of a weak magnetic field on a star that does not have an extended convective envelope. This calls to question the origin of the magnetic field.},

	abstract = {The double or extended main-sequence turnoffs ({MSTOs}) in the color–magnitude diagram ({CMD}) of intermediate-age massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud are generally interpreted as age spreads of a few hundred Myr. However, such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40–300 Myr), which challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the {MSTOs} of star clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation on the main-sequence lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a fainter and redder {MSTO} with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer {MSTO} when age is larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the {MSTO} caused by a typical rotation rate is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could lead to the double or extended {MSTOs} in the {CMD} of the star clusters with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant, and it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution, and the rotationally induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters, but younger clusters would have an extended {MSTO}. Moreover, the effects of rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some “multiple populations” in globular clusters.},

It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca+ emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root.

	abstract = {Astrometric data from the recent Gaia Data Release 1 have been matched against the sample of stars from Kepler with known rotation periods. A total of 1299 bright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good astrometric solutions, most with temperatures above 5000 K. From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main-sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting that the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ∼300 pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations that is created by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.},

Using 30,305 stars with good distance estimates, we select 16,248 as being likely main-sequence single stars centered within a 0.5 mag region about a 1 Gyr isochrone, removing many subgiants and unresolved binary stars from the sample. The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by {McQuillan} et al., is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is correlated with height above the Galacitc plane, with the ratio of rapidly rotating younger stars dropping strongly for stars above Z {\textgreater} 90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of Δ{MG} ∼ 0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient may indicate that main-sequence evolution produces offsets in color–magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.},

The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which can be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to be an accurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of rotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A prominent observational feature of the mass–rotation period diagrams of open clusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and persistence of this slow-rotator sequence across several billion years imply an approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In particular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently toward longer periods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the ≈700 Myr Praesepe and the 1 Gyr {NGC} 6811 clusters, however, are not fully consistent with this general pattern. While the stars of 1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} on the slow-rotator sequence of the older {NGC} 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger Praesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (≲0.8 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). In other words, it seems that low-mass stars have not been spinning down in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a manifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The resurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate for that lost at the surface due to wind braking. In our model the internal redistribution of angular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling occurs at different ages for stars of different masses. The semi-empirical mass dependence of the rotational coupling timescale included in our model produces an evolution of the slow-rotator sequence in very good agreement with the observations. Our model, in particular, explains the stalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and {NGC} 6811, and predicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other mass ranges.},

The observed relationship between mass, age and rotation in open clusters shows the progressive development of a slow-rotator sequence among stars possessing a radiative interior and a convective envelope during their pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution. After 0.6 Gyr, most cluster members of this type have settled on this sequence. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Aims: The observed clustering on this sequence suggests that it corresponds to some equilibrium or asymptotic condition that still lacks a complete theoretical interpretation, and which is crucial to our understanding of the stellar angular momentum evolution. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Methods: We couple a rotational evolution model, which takes internal differential rotation into account, with classical and new proposals for the wind braking law, and fit models to the data using a Monte Carlo Markov chain ({MCMC}) method tailored to the problem at hand. We explore to what extent these models are able to reproduce the mass and time dependence of the stellar rotational evolution on the slow-rotator sequence. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: The description of the evolution of the slow-rotator sequence requires taking the transfer of angular momentum from the radiative core to the convective envelope into account. We find that, in the mass range 0.85-1.10 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, the core-envelope coupling timescale for stars in the slow-rotator sequence scales as M{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-7.28{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. Quasi-solid body rotation is achieved only after 1-2 Gyr, depending on stellar mass, which implies that observing small deviations from the Skumanich law (P ∝ √\{t\}) would require period data of older open clusters than is available to date. The observed evolution in the 0.1-2.5 Gyr age range and in the 0.85-1.10 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} mass range is best reproduced by assuming an empirical mass dependence of the wind angular momentum loss proportional to the convective turnover timescale and to the stellar moment of inertia. Period isochrones based on our {MCMC} fit provide a tool for inferring stellar ages of solar-like main-sequence stars from their mass and rotation period that is largely independent of the wind braking model adopted. These effectively represent gyro-chronology relationships that take the physics of the two-zone model for the stellar angular momentum evolution into account.},

	abstract = {Context. Co-rotating spots at different latitudes on the stellar surface generate periodic photometric variability and can be useful proxies for detecting differential rotation ({DR}). This is a major ingredient of the solar dynamo, but observations of stellar {DR} are very sparse. Because the Kepler space telescope steadily collects more data, we are interested in detecting {DR} using photometric information of a star. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Aims: The main goal of this paper is to develop a fast method for determining stellar {DR} from photometric data. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Methods: We ran an extensive Monte Carlo simulation of differentially rotating spotted stars with very different properties to investigate the detectability of {DR}. For different noise levels the resulting light curves were prewhitened using Lomb-Scargle periodograms to derive parameters for a global sine fit to detect periodicities. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: We show under which conditions {DR} can successfully be detected from photometric data, and in which cases the light curve provides insufficient or even misleading information on the stellar rotation law. In our simulations, the most significant period P1{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}out{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} is on average 2.4\% shorter than the actual spot rotation-rate. This period was detected in 96.2\% of all light curves. The signature of {DR} is a second period close to P1{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}out{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} in our model. For the noise-free case, we found such a period in 64.2\% of all stars. Calculating the measured latitudinal shear of two distinct spots α{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}out{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and comparing this with the known original spot rotation-rates shows that the real value is on average 3.2\% lower. Comparing the total equator-to-pole shear α to α{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}out{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, we find that α is underestimated by 8.8\%, especially the detection of {DR} for stars with α \&lt; 6\% is challenging. Finally, we applied our method to four differentially rotating Kepler stars and found close agreement with results from detailed modeling. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The method we developed is capable of measuring stellar rotation periods and detecting {DR} with relatively high accuracy and is suitable for large data sets. We will apply our analysis to more Kepler data in a forthcoming paper.},

Parallel chromospheric Ca {II} H and K emission data from the Mount Wilson Observatory span the entire interval. The extended data strengthen the relationship between chromospheric and brightness variability at visible wavelengths derived previously. We show that the full range of photometric variation has probably now been observed for a majority of the program stars. Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable according to an objective statistical criterion. On a year-to-year timescale, young active stars become fainter when their Ca {II} emission increases, while older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca {II} emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y stellar filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample.},

	abstract = {The correlation between stellar activity, as measured by the indicator {DRHK}, and the Rossby number Ro in late-type stars is revisited in light of recent developments in solar dynamo theory. Different stellar interior models, based on both mixing-length theory and the full spectrum of turbulence, are used in order to see to what extent the correlation of activity with Rossby number is model dependent, or otherwise can be considered universal. Although we ﬁnd some modest model dependence, we ﬁnd that the correlation of activity with Rossby number is signiﬁcantly better than with rotation period alone for all the models we consider. Dynamo theory suggests that activity should scale with the dynamo number. A current model of the solar dynamo, the so-called interface dynamo, proposes that the ampliﬁcation of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld by differential rotation (the v-effect) and the production of the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld from toroidal by helical turbulence (the a-effect) take place in different, adjacent layers near the base of the convection zone. A new scale analysis based on the interface dynamo shows that the appropriate dynamo number does not depend on the Rossby number alone, but also depends on an additional dimensionless factor related to the differential rotation. This leads to a new interpretation of the correlation between activity and Rossby number, which in turn leads to some conclusions about the magnitude of differential rotation in the dynamo layers of late-type main-sequence stars.},

We find that half of the rapidly rotating \${\textgreater}\$0.3 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ stars are confirmed or candidate binary systems. The remaining \${\textgreater}0.3\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ fast rotators have not been searched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We found previously that nearly all rapidly rotating \${\textgreater}\$0.3 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ stars in the Hyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different \$P\_\{rot\}\$ distributions. We also compare the observed \$P\_\{rot\}\$ distribution in Praesepe to that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe the clear bimodal \$P\_\{rot\}\$ distribution predicted by Brown (2014) for \${\textgreater}\$0.5 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ stars at the age of Praesepe, but 0.25\$-\$0.5 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ stars do show stronger bimodality. In addition, we find that \${\textgreater}\$60{\textbackslash}\% of early M dwarfs in Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al. (2015), which suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to solar-type stars and fully convective stars. The incompleteness of surveys for binaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models, since the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single stars.},

Comparing the effective temperature--\$P\_\{rot\}\$ distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4{\textasciitilde}d slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This \$P\_\{rot\}\$ difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun, and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57{\textasciitilde}Myr. However, this \$P\_\{rot\}\$ difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars, and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular-momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (\${\textbackslash}leq\$1 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). Unfortunately, rotation period \$(P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\})\$ measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}rm age\}\$): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag{\textbackslash}"ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the \${\textbackslash}approx\$1.4-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\}\$ stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia {DR}2 to identify likely single-star members of the \${\textbackslash}approx\$1-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\}\$ for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from \${\textbackslash}approx\$0.8 to \${\textbackslash}approx\$0.6 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in {NGC} 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, {NGC} 6811's color-\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\}\$ sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} {\textbackslash}approx 4295\$ K (K5V, 0.7 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\}\$ for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\}\$ stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

	abstract = {We present an extended grid of state-of-the art stellar models for low-mass stars including updated physics (nuclear reaction rates, surface boundary condition, mass-loss rate, angular momentum transport, torque and rotation-induced mixing prescriptions). We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the {STAREVOL} code, we provide an updated {PMS} grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to \$Z=0.0134\$. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5{\textbackslash}Ms with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity -- and its constitutive physics -- is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range. These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, {TESS} and {PLATO}.},

	abstract = {Broad and shallow absorption lines in stellar spectra are shown to be due to axial rotation. The evidence is based upon the following facts: (a) the broadening depends upon wave-length, as required by the Doppler principle; (b) in spectroscop'ic binaries there is a distinct correlation between line width on one side and period and amplitude on the other; and (c) as was shown by Elvey, the contours of "dish-shaped" lines agree well with the theoretical shapes of lines of rapidly rotating stars. A survey of the spectra of stars of various types shows that rapid rotation is peculiar to the earliest spectral classes. The B- and A-stars display the greatest tendency toward rapid rotation. In the F's the proportion of rapidly rotating stars is smaller, and in classes G, K, and M no cases of rapid rotation have been observed in single stars. The effect of rotation upon the contours of components of spectroscopic binaries is discussed. In a Virginis the stronger component is found to rotate with an equatorial velocity of 200 km/sec., while for the fainter component the rotational velocity is not more than about 50 km/sec. This indicates a marked difference in the size of the com- ponents. The ratio of the radii is roughly 4 to i. The contours of lines in i{\textasciitilde} Ursae Majoris suggest an equatorial velocity of about 200 km/sec. This single star is thus similar to the stronger component of a Virginis. Both stars are found to be stable, but the characteristic quantity w2/27r{\textasciitilde}yp is not far from the critical value where the Maclaurin ellipsoids of rotation lose stability. It is suggested that there is a transition between close s{\textasciitilde}ectroscopic binaries and rapidly rotating single -stars in the earliest spectral classes. Observations do not establish the direction in which this transition proceeds},

There are many physical factors that contribute to the formation of the contour. The most important are: (1) the abundance of the absorbing atoms in the gas, (2) the Stark effect, and (3) Doppler effects due to the rotation of the stars. We are here concerned with the first of these, which is usually designated as `natural widening' of spectral lines. H. N. Russell and others have shown that this type of broadening is particularly important in the stars because of the large number of absorbing atoms present in a stellar reversing layer. It is responsible for the enormous widths of the H and K lines of Ca+ in the later spectral types.},

The contours can be represented by an equation of the simple exponential type. The presence of the Stark effect is shown by the asymmetry of He 4388 and by the "forbidden" line X 4470 of helium in the violet wing of He 4472. "Dish-shaped" contours of the lines in the spectra of i6 X Aqi., 4 {\textasciitilde} Cor., i{\textasciitilde} q Tau., On., and 22 X Cep. indicate axial rotation of these stars. By Mime's theory, logarithms of the number of atoms responsible for producing an absorption line are computed for various assumptions of the physical properties of the stars. These are shown in the form of curves by plots of log N{\textasciitilde} against the tempera- ture. The number of atoms {NHf} is determined for each star with use of Unsold's theory. To eliminate the Stark effect and the broadening due to rotation, {NHf} is determined by comparing the areas of the observed contours with those given by theory. A value of 0.1 was arbitrarily chosen forf, and the resulting numbers of atoms have been compared with the curves computed from Milne's theory. The observations support the assump- tion that the coefficient of absorption varies with the pressure, rather than that it is a constant. The observations indicate pressures of 783 dynes/cm2 to 9270 dynes/cm2 for g equal to {\textasciitilde} cm/sec.,2 the temperatures being from 10,0000 to 30,000°.

We restrict our study to the case where the stars are submitted to a moderate wind which obeys Skumanich's (1972) spindown relation. Stellar models are computed with the new {OPAL} opacities, and adjustable stellar parameters are calibrated using the Sun. The results of our numerical simulations are precisely compared with lithium and beryllium abundances observed in seven galactic lusters. The red side of the lithium dip is well explained by rotation-induced mixing and a beryllium dip consistent with observations is predicted. The rotation velocity dispersion in the Hyades accounts for the lithium abundance dispersion.},

	abstract = {We present an investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke ({GSF}) instability using axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations near the equator of a differentially rotating radiation zone. This instability may provide an important contribution to angular momentum transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq Cartesian shearing box model, which represents a small patch of a differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations are also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial direction. The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric instability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability. This is no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability behaves nonlinearly in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations -- and those in 3D with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction -- quickly develop strong jets along the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to predator-prey-like temporal dynamics. In 3D, the instability initially produces homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport, though in some cases jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a simple theory for nonlinear saturation of the {GSF} instability and its resulting angular momentum transport. This theory is straightforward to implement in stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation. We estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute towards explaining the missing angular momentum transport required in red giant stars, and play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline.},

	abstract = {We continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke ({GSF}) instability in differentially rotating radiation zones. This instability may be a key player in transporting angular momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains mostly unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability, whereas here we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq model in a modified shearing box for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations with stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear instability and derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear evolution. The instability is found to behave very differently compared with its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the development of strong zonal jets ("layering" in the angular momentum), which can considerably enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations. The jets are, in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle that corresponds initially with that of the linear modes, but which evolves with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability transports angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it does at the equator, and we estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute to the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters.},

We computed stellar evolution models with rotation and model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant diﬀusive process parameterised by an additional viscosity in the equation of angular momentum transport. We constrained the values of this viscosity to match the mean core rotation rates of red giants and their behaviour with mass and evolution using asteroseismic indicators along the red giant branch and in the red clump.
Results. For red giants in the hydrogen-shell burning phase, the transport of angular momentum must be more eﬃcient in more massive stars. The additional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude in the mass range M ∼ 1–2.5 M . As stars evolve along the red giant branch, the eﬃciency of the internal transport of angular momentum must increase for low-mass stars (M 2 M ) and remain approximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M M 2.5 M ). In red clump stars, the additional viscosities must be an order of magnitude higher than in younger red giants of similar mass during the hydrogen-shell burning phase.
Conclusions. In combination with previous eﬀorts, we obtain a clear picture of how the physical processes acting in stellar interiors should redistribute angular momentum from the end of the main sequence until the core-helium burning phase for low- and intermediate-mass stars to satisfy the asteroseismic constraints.},

We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the eﬃciency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of {KIC} 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results. We ﬁnd that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation proﬁles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant {KIC} 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insuﬃcient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity νadd corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be νadd = 3 × 104 cm2 s−1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.},

Linear rotational splittings were computed for a sequence of 1.3 M models. Rotation proﬁles were derived from our evolutionary models and eigenfunctions from linear adiabatic oscillation calculations.
Results. We ﬁnd that transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismic observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical description of stars that could have an impact on the rotation proﬁles. For instance, we ﬁnd that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability does not extract enough angular momentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase of the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to signiﬁcantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch.
Conclusions. Our results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontal turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanism not included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow down the rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.},

The space-based photometry reveals pulsation properties previously inaccessible to ground-based observations. We observe a sharp dichotomy in oscillation mode line widths at roughly 800 s, such that white dwarf pulsations with periods exceeding 800 s have substantially broader mode line widths, more reminiscent of a damped harmonic oscillator than a heat-driven pulsator. Extended Kepler coverage also permits extensive mode identification: we identify the spherical degree of 87 out of 201 unique radial orders, providing direct constraints of the rotation period for 20 of these 27 {DAVs}, more than doubling the number of white dwarfs with rotation periods determined via asteroseismology. We also obtain spectroscopy from 4 m-class telescopes for all {DAVs} with Kepler photometry. Using these homogeneously analyzed spectra, we estimate the overall mass of all 27 {DAVs}, which allows us to measure white dwarf rotation as a function of mass, constraining the endpoints of angular momentum in low- and intermediate-mass stars. We find that 0.51–0.73 M⊙ white dwarfs, which evolved from 1.7–3.0 M⊙ {ZAMS} progenitors, have a mean rotation period of 35 hr with a standard deviation of 28 hr, with notable exceptions for higher-mass white dwarfs.

	abstract = {The detection of mixed modes that are split by rotation in Kepler red giants has made it possible to probe the internal rotation profiles of these stars, which brings new constraints on the transport of angular momentum in stars. Mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions of intermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). Our aim was to exploit\& the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amount of radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars using Kepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars. We selected a subsample of Kepler secondary clump stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By applying a thorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of both gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes (trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then used these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al. 2013). We obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating \$1.8{\textbackslash}pm0.3\$ to \$3.2{\textbackslash}pm1.0\$ times faster than the envelope. The last target was found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. This demonstrates that an efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the short-lived subgiant phase, or once He-burning has started in the core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.},

We demonstrate that magnetized Taylor–Couette flows with such profiles become unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations if at least one of the diffusivities is finite. We also find that for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the lines of marginal instability scale with the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. In the limit the lines of marginal instability completely lie below the line for and for they completely lie above this line. For any finite value of , however, the lines of marginal instability cross the line , which separates slow from fast rotation. The minimum values of the field strength and the rotation rate that are needed for the instability (slightly) grow if the rotation law becomes flat. In this case, the electric current of the background field becomes so strong that the current-driven Tayler instability (which also exists without rotation) appears in the bifurcation map at low Hartmann numbers.},

	abstract = {The interaction of differential rotation and toroidal fields that are current-free in the gap between two corotating axially unbounded cylinders is considered. It is shown that nonaxisymmetric perturbations are unstable if the rotation rate and Alfv{\textbackslash}'en frequency of the field are of the same order, almost independent of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. For the very steep rotation law {\textbackslash}Omega{\textbackslash}propto R{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} (the Rayleigh limit) and for small Pm the threshold values of rotation and field for this Azimuthal {MagnetoRotational} Instability ({AMRI}) scale with the ordinary Reynolds number and the Hartmann number, resp. A laboratory experiment with liquid metals like sodium or gallium in a Taylor-Couette container has been designed on the basis of this finding. For fluids with more flat rotation laws the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number are no longer typical quantities for the instability. For the weakly nonlinear system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy are derived for magnetic Prandtl numbers {\textbackslash}leq 1. We find that the magnetic energy grows monotonically with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, while the kinetic energy grows with Rm/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{Pm\}. The resulting turbulent Schmidt number, as the ratio of the `eddy' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar (such as lithium) is of order 20 for Pm=1, but for small Pm it drops to order unity. Hence, in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the transport of angular momentum by {AMRI} is always accompanied by an intense mixing of the plasma, until the rotation becomes rigid.},

	abstract = {Various effective temperature scales have been proposed over the years. Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematic differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are still present. We present an investigation based on the Infrared Flux Method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]{\textless}-2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities.},

The method of Kippenhahn \& Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars (“shellular rotation law”, cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied.},

Until now, laws of the form T\_eff {\textbackslash}propto g\_eff{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta\} have been used, but they are only valid for slowly rotating stars. We propose a simple model that can describe the latitudinal variations in the flux of rotating stars at any rotation rate. This model assumes that the energy flux is a divergence-free vector that is antiparallel to the effective gravity. When mass distribution can be described by a Roche model, the latitudinal variations in the effective temperature only depend on a single parameter, namely the ratio of the equatorial velocity to the Keplerian velocity. We validate this model by comparing its predictions to those of the most realistic two-dimensional models of rotating stars issued from the {ESTER} code. The agreement is very good, as it is with the observations of two rapidly rotating stars, \{{\textbackslash}alpha\} Aql and \{{\textbackslash}alpha\} Leo. We suggest that as long as a gray atmosphere can be accepted, the inversion of data on flux distribution coming from interferometric observations of rotating stars uses such a model, which has just one free parameter.},

Instead of von Zeipel's result, according to which the energy flux in the radiative region of a rotating star is proportional to the effective gravity (rotational darkening), a more general relation is obtained. It is shown that - depending on the angular-velocity distribution and the opacity law - rotational darkening can be more or less pronounced than that obtained from the von Zeipel theorem. It is also possible that the radiative flux increases with decreasing effective gravity (rotational brightening).},

	abstract = {The evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main sequence ({ZAMS}) masses in the range 8 to 25 M\_sun is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the {ZAMS} ranges from zero to {\textasciitilde} 70 \% of break-up. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of rotationally induced circulation and instablities. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of 1E16...1E17 erg s. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to break-up. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.},

	abstract = {Recent observations show He- and N-enhancements in fast rotating O-type stars, while studies on shear mixing in rotating stars have shown that the μ-gradients generally inhibit mixing processes. However, these studies (including ours) ignored the other sources of turbulence, such as semiconvection and horizontal turbulence, which may be present in the medium and may modify the onset of shear mixing. Indeed, in massive stars most of the zone where μ-gradients would inhibit mixing according to the Richardson criterion is semiconvective, i.e. such a zone would experience some turbulence anyway. This leads us to introduce the following working hypothesis: in a semiconvection region (or in any zone with other sources of turbulence) some fraction of the local energy excess in the shear is degraded by turbulence to change the local entropy gradient. Consistently with this hypothesis we derive the effects of the shear on the entropy gradient, then on the T- and μ-gradients, and express the fraction of the μ-gradient which can be diffused. From the basic equations describing the evolution of temperature perturbations we obtain the velocities of fluid elements under some specific conditions, and then we get the associated diffusion coefficient D. Interestingly enough, the values of D tend towards the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection, when the shears become negligible, and towards the coefficient by Zahn (1992A\&amp;A...265..115Z; cf. also Maeder and Meynet 1996A\&amp;A...313..140M) when shears dominate. We also examine the coupling of shear mixing and thermal transport; a third order equation expressing the combined effects is obtained. The solutions for shears in semiconvective and radiative zones are examined in detail. The main result of the above developments is the slight progressive erosion of the μ-barriers in stars, for cases where the usual form of the Richardson criterion would have imposed an insuperable threshold. In Appendices A and B we rediscuss the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection and find a more general expression, not limited to the adiabatic case.},

This algorithm flags targets that show characteristic signatures of solar-like oscillations. We manually vetted the resulting list of targets to confirm the presence of solar-like oscillations. Using the probability densities computed by the algorithm, we measured the global asteroseismic parameters νmax and ∆ν.
Results. We produce a catalogue of 4177 solar-like oscillators, reporting ∆ν and νmax for 98\% of the total star count. The asteroseismic data reveal a vast coverage of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, populating the red giant branch, the subgiant regime, and extending towards the main sequence.
Conclusions. A crossmatch with external catalogues shows that 25 of the detected solar-like oscillators are a component of a spectroscopic binary, and 28 are confirmed planet host stars. These results provide the potential for precise, independent asteroseismic constraints on these and any additional {TESS} targets of interest.},

	abstract = {{RADIO} pulsars are thought to born with spin periods of 0.02-0.5 s and space velocities of 100-1000 km/s, and they are inferred to have initial dipole magnetic fields of 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}. The average space velocity of a normal star in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.},

We concentrate on the waves excited by core convection in a 3Msun, Pop I main sequence star. Here, we want to examine the role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe the behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport. We use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows variable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of rotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of spherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves. It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves in non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition of angular momentum by such waves is important.},

	abstract = {The detection of mixed modes in subgiants and red giants by the {CoRoT} and {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} space-borne missions allows us to investigate the internal structure of evolved low-mass stars. In particular, the measurement of the mean core rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraints on the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistribution in stars. It showed that the current stellar evolution codes including the modelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. An additional physical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core is thus necessary. Our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. To this end, we developed a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both the mean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. In this article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismic observations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer is obtained. This is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at three evolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed by {CoRoT} and Kepler. We show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regions of subgiants and red giants. However, this transport of angular momentum from the core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction in subgiants and early red giants. In contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixed modes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the core contraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. Our results thus indicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observed spin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is to be invoked for subgiants and early red giants.},

	abstract = {Context. Rotation is one of the key physical mechanisms that deeply impact the evolution of stars. Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of angular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.
Aims. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating, stably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modelled and its strength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent transport is anisotropic. So far only phenomenological prescriptions have been proposed for the transport in the horizontal direction. This, however, constitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar hydrodynamics in evolution codes. We aim to improve its modelling.
Methods. We derived a new theoretical prescription for the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral formalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification, rotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent transport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of the radial differential rotation is derived. We implemented this framework in the stellar evolution code {STAREVOL} and quantified its impact on the rotational and structural evolution of solar metallicity low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red giant branch.
Results. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as N ⁴ τ ² /(2Ω ² ), N and Ω being the buoyancy and rotation frequencies respectively and τ a time characterizing the source of turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar strength in average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions even if it can be locally larger below the convective envelope. Hence the models computed with the new formalism still build up too steep internal rotation gradients compared to helioseismic and asteroseismic constraints. As a consequence, a complementary transport mechanism such as internal gravity waves or magnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of angular momentum along stellar evolution.
Conclusions. The new prescription links for the first time the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones to their stratification and rotation. This constitutes important theoretical progress and demonstrates how turbulent closure models should be improved to get firm conclusions on the potential importance of other processes that transport angular momentum and chemicals inside stars along their evolution.},

Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence.
Results. We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as M˙ ∝ R2 Ω1.33 M−3.36. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.
Conclusions. There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be signiﬁcant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

Methods: We use 1D thermal pressure driven hydrodynamic wind models run using the Versatile Advection Code. Using in situ measurements of the solar wind, we produce models for the slow and fast components of the solar wind. We consider two radically different methods for scaling the base temperature of the wind to other stars: in Model A, we assume that wind temperatures are fundamentally linked to coronal temperatures, and in Model B, we assume that the sound speed at the base of the wind is a fixed fraction of the escape velocity. In Paper {II} of this series, we use observationally constrained rotational evolution models to derive wind mass loss rates. Results: Our model for the solar wind provides an excellent description of the real solar wind far from the solar surface, but is unrealistic within the solar corona. We run a grid of 1200 wind models to derive relations for the wind properties as a function of stellar mass, radius, and wind temperature. Using these results, we explore how wind properties depend on stellar mass and rotation. Conclusions: Based on our two assumptions about the scaling of the wind temperature, we argue that there is still significant uncertainty in how these properties should be determined. Resolution of this uncertainty will probably require both the application of solar wind physics to other stars and detailed observational constraints on the properties of stellar winds. In the final section of this paper, we give step by step instructions for how to apply our results to calculate the stellar wind conditions far from the stellar surface.},

Our parameter study includes 50 simulations covering a wide range of relative magnetic field strengths and rotation rates, extending from the slow- and approaching the fast-magnetic-rotator regimes. Using the simulations to compute the angular momentum loss, we derive a semi-analytic formulation for the external torque on the star that fits all of the simulations to a precision of a few percent. This formula provides a simple method for computing the magnetic braking of Sun-like stars due to magnetized stellar winds, which properly includes the dependence on the strength of the magnetic field, mass loss rate, stellar radius, surface gravity, and spin rate, and which is valid for both slow and fast rotators.},

	abstract = {We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including {PMS} to {ZAMS} spin up, prompt {ZAMS} spin down, and the early-{MS} convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using the Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale ({AIMS}) stellar parameter inference code, we infer the masses and ages of a set of representative artiﬁcial stars for which models were computed with the Code d’Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire ({CESTAM}; the T stands for Transport) evolution code, taking into account rotationally induced mixing and atomic diﬀusion, including radiative acceleration. The observed constraints are asteroseismic and classical properties. The grid of stellar models used for the optimization search include neither atomic diﬀusion nor rotationally induced mixing. The diﬀerences between real and retrieved parameters then provide an estimate of the errors made when neglecting transport processes in stellar parameter inference.
Results. We show that for masses lower than 1.3 M , rotation dominates the transport of chemical elements and strongly reduces the eﬀect of atomic diﬀusion, with net surface abundance modiﬁcations similar to solar values. At higher mass, atomic diﬀusion and rotation are competing equally. Above 1.44 M , atomic diﬀusion dominates in stellar models with initial rotation lower than 80 km s−1 producing a chemical peculiarity which is not observed in Kepler Legacy stars. This indicates that a transport process of chemical elements is missing, probably linked to the missing transport process of angular momentum needed to explain rotation proﬁles in solar-like stars. Importantly, neglecting rotation and atomic diﬀusion (including radiative acceleration) in the models, when inferring the parameters of F-type stars, may lead to respective errors of ≈5\%, ≈2.5\%, and ≈25\% for stellar masses, radii, and ages.
Conclusions. Atomic diﬀusion (including radiative acceleration) and rotational mixing should be taken into account in stellar models in order to determine accurate stellar parameters. When atomic diﬀusion and shellular rotation are both included, they enable stellar evolution codes to reproduce the observed metal and helium surface abundances for stars with masses up to 1.4 M at solar metallicity. However, if rotation is actually uniform for these stars (as observations seem to indicate), then an additional chemical mixing process is needed together with a revised formulation of rotational mixing. For higher masses, an additional mixing process is needed in any case.},

	abstract = {In the course of conducting a deep (14.5 {\textasciitilde}{\textless} r {\textasciitilde}{\textless} 23), 20 night survey for transiting planets in the rich {\textasciitilde}550 Myr old open cluster M37 we have measured the rotation periods of 575 stars which lie near the cluster main sequence, with masses 0.2 Msun {\textasciitilde}{\textless} M {\textasciitilde}{\textless} 1.3 Msun. This is the largest sample of rotation periods for a cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate a number of relations between rotation period, color and the amplitude of photometric variability. Stars with M {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.8 Msun show a tight correlation between period and mass with heavier stars rotating more rapidly. There is a group of 4 stars with P {\textgreater} 15 days that fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution. Below 0.8 Msun the stars continue to follow the period-mass correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to shorter periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with observations of other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower-main sequence stellar angular momentum evolution. We find that the model reproduces the observations for solar mass stars, but discrepancies are apparent for stars with 0.6 {\textasciitilde}{\textless} M {\textasciitilde}{\textless} 1.0 Msun. We also find that for late-K through early-M dwarf stars in this cluster rapid rotators tend to be bluer than slow rotators in B-V but redder than slow rotators in V-I\_\{C\}. This result supports the hypothesis that the significant discrepancy between the observed and predicted temperatures and radii of low-mass main sequence stars is due to stellar activity.},

Ninety-two images were obtained during this period through an intermediate band filter centered at 815.9 nm. More than 1500 sources with I magnitudes between 12.5 and 20 were monitored. We find that essentially every star brighter than 16th mag (where the precision is {\textless}0.01 mag) is a variable, with about half having a peak-to-peak variation of {\textasciitilde}0.2 mag or more. A clear correlation is found between the level of variability and infrared excess emission, in the sense that stars with evidence for circumstellar disks have larger amplitudes of variation. A search for periodic variables was carried out and 369 such stars were discovered, most or all of which are rotating, spotted T Tauri stars. Periodic variables are most commonly found among the low amplitude variables. 46\% of the stars with magnitudes between 12.5 and 16 and standard deviation, {\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 0.1 mag, were found to be periodic, whereas only 24\% of the stars in the same magnitude range with yielded periods. Our work confirms the existence of a bimodal period distribution, with peaks near 2 and 8 days, for stars with and a unimodal distribution peaked near 2 days, for lower mass stars. We show that a statistically significant correlation exists between infrared excess emission and rotation in the sense that slower rotators are more likely to show evidence of circumstellar disks. Slowly rotating stars, with angular velocities, {\textless}i{\textgreater}ω{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textless} 1 radian/d, corresponding to rotation periods longer than 6.28 d, have a mean infrared excess emission, , indicative of the presence of inner disks, while rapid rotators, with radians/d, corresponding to rotation periods shorter than 3.14 d, have a much smaller mean of . This supports the hypothesis that disks are involved in regulating stellar rotation during the pre-main sequence phase. We explore a simple and commonly adopted model of rotational evolution in which stars conserve angular velocity while locked to a disk and conserve angular momentum once released. If these assumptions are valid, and if the locking period is 8 days, we find that more than half of the stars in the {ONC} are no longer locked to disks and that an exponential decay model with a disk-locking half-life of about 0.5–1 My fits the observations well. Assuming that the mean ages of the higher and lower mass stars are the same, the faster rotation of the lower mass stars can be understood as either a consequence of a shorter disk-locking time or a shorter initial disk-locking period, or both.},

This first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in {NGC} 6530, the young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly uniform for 0.5 days {\textless} P {\textless} 10 days; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level (log {LX} /L bol ≈ -3.3). However, we find a significant positive correlation between {LX} /L bol and corotation radius, suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in {NGC} 6530 is broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster ({ONC}), but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the {ONC} and other young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we argue that {NGC} 6530 may be slightly younger than the {ONC}, making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young, low-mass stars.},

We detect periodic variability for 74\% of the cluster members in this mass range that are within our field-of-view, and 93\% of the members with 0.7 Msun {\textless} M {\textless} 1.0 Msun. This increases, by a factor of five, the number of Pleiades members with measured periods. Included in our sample are 14 newly identified probable cluster members which have proper motions, photometry, and rotation periods consistent with membership. We compare this data to the rich sample of spectroscopically determined projected equatorial rotation velocities (vsini) available in the literature for this cluster. For stars with M {\textgreater} 0.85 Msun the rotation periods, vsini and radius estimates are consistent with the stars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate differential rotation law is assumed. For stars with M {\textless} 0.85 Msun the inferred sini values are systematically larger than 1.0. These observations imply that the combination of measured parameters P(vsini)/R is too large by {\textbackslash}sim 24\% for low-mass stars in this cluster. By comparing our new mass-period relation for the Pleiades to the slightly older cluster M35, we confirm previous indications that the spin-down stalls at {\textbackslash}sim 100 Myr for the slowest rotating stars with 0.7 Msun {\textless} M {\textless} 1.1 Msun a fact which may indicate that the internal transport of angular momentum is inefficient in slowly rotating solar mass stars.},

We report rotation periods for 441 stars within this field and determine their cluster membership and binarity based on a decade-long radial velocity survey, proper-motion measurements, and multiband photometric observations. We find that 310 of the stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. The distribution of rotation periods for cluster members span more than 2 orders of magnitude from ∼0.1 to 15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the timespan of the survey. With an age between the zero-age main sequence and the Hyades, and with ∼6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80\% of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color–period plane, and define clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The M35 color–period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition between the two rotational states, of ∼60 Myr and ∼140 Myr for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades, confirm the Skumanich spin-down dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the rotational sequences in the M35 color–period diagram support the use of rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use such gyrochronology to determine “gyro-ages” for M35 from 134 Myr to 161 Myr. We use the M35 data to evaluate new color dependences for the rotational isochrones.},

We determined accurate rotation periods for more than 120 sources whose cluster membership was confirmed by common proper motion and colour-magnitude fits to the clusters' isochrones. This allowed us to determine the effect of magnetic braking on a wide range of spectral types for expected ages of ∼600 Myr for the Hyades and Praesepe. Both clusters show a tight and nearly linear relation between J-Ks colour and rotation period in the F, G and K spectral range. This confirms that loss of angular momentum was significant enough that stars with strongly different initial rotation rates have converged to the same rotation period for a given mass, by the ages of Hyades and Praesepe. In the case of the Hyades, our colour-period sequence extends well into the M dwarf regime and shows a steep increase in the scatter of the colour-period relation, with identification of numerous rapid rotators from ∼0.5 M⊙ down to the lowest masses probed by our survey (∼0.25 M⊙). This provides crucial constraints on the rotational braking time-scales and further clears the way to use gyrochronology as an accurate age measurement tool for main-sequence stars.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \&amp; Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

	abstract = {We show that the Richardson criterion, even in its improved form found recently, is insufficient by itself to describe the occurrence of shear instabilities in rotating stars. The coupling between the shears and their effects on the T-gradient must be accounted for. When this is done, we obtain a new more complete criterion, in which the shear properties essentially depend on one critical dimensionless number θ. We must distinguish the cases of radiative and semiconvective
zones. For a radiative zone, the stability criterion becomes (1)/(4) (({dU})/(dz)){\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}{\textless}(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_). If this
condition is not realized, we show that there is always a range of scales in the turbulent spectrum where shear instabilities occur. The corresponding diffusion coefficient, depending only on θ, is
given. In a semiconvective zone, the stability criterion, with respect to shears, is (1)/(4)
(({dU})/(dz)){\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}{\textless}(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_)-(1)/(1+2sqrt(6))
(gδ)/(H\_p\_) (∇\_rad\_-∇\_ad\_). We also derive the
appropriate diffusion coefficient when the above criterion is not satisfied. Different ranges of turbulent scales may also exist,
depending on θ. Interestingly enough, we may notice that the
above criterion is also that expressing the transition from shear to semiconvective instabilities.},

	abstract = {Aims: We study the evolution of stellar rotation and wind properties for low-mass main-sequence stars. Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to constrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their properties evolve with time on the main-sequence. Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed rotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence. Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}propto R\_{\textbackslash}star{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}star{\textasciicircum}\{1.33\} M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textasciicircum}\{-3.36\}\$. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age. Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

	abstract = {We present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, {LX} /L {bolvpropRoβ}, is fit as β = -2.70 ± 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = -2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/Ω{vpropΩ}0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro {\textless} 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

Actually, it is the absolute instability which is the most relevant and important for magnetic {TC} flow experiments. The absolute {AMRI}, unlike the convective one, stays in the device, displaying a sustained growth that can be experimentally detected. We also study the global {AMRI} in a {TC} flow of finite height using {DNS} and find that its emerging butterfly-type structure -- a spatio-temporal variation in the form of upward and downward traveling waves -- is in a very good agreement with the linear stability analysis, which indicates the presence of two dominant absolute {AMRI} modes in the flow giving rise to this global butterfly pattern.},

The solution must pass through three critical points, whose significance is explained in terms of the characteristic velocities with which disturbances propagate. A numerical solution is obtained for typical parameters The magnetic field produces only a modest tendency toward co-rotation of the outer corona, but the magnetic stresses apply a torque to the Sun equal to that required to produce effective co-rotation out to the radial distance where the radial Mach number equals unity. For typical solar-wind values this will occur between 15 and 50 solar radii out, which implies a substantial loss in the angular momentum of the Sun.},

We have selected a sample of 259 dwarfs in the B-V range 0.5-2.0, including 110 field stars and 149 members of the Pleiades, Hyades, alpha Persei, {IC} 2602 and {IC} 2391 open clusters. All the stars have been observed with {ROSAT}, and most of them have photometrically-measured rotation periods available. Our results confirm that two emission regimes exist, one in which the rotation period is a good predictor of the total X-ray luminosity, and the other in which a constant saturated X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is attained; we present a quantitative estimate of the critical rotation periods below which stars of different masses (or spectral types) enter the saturated regime. In this work we have also empirically derived a characteristic time scale, tau{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} , which we have used to investigate the relationship between the X-ray emission level and an X-ray-based Rossby number R{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = P{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}/tau{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}: we show that our empirical time scale tau{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} resembles the theoretical convective turnover time for 0.4 \&lt;{\textasciitilde} M/M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 1.2, but it also has the same functional dependence on B-V as L{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1/2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} in the color range 0.5 \&lt;{\textasciitilde} B-V \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 1.5.

	abstract = {X-ray observations of low-mass stars in open clusters are critical to understanding the dependence of magnetic activity on stellar properties and their evolution. Praesepe and the Hyades, two of the nearest, most-studied open clusters, are among the best available laboratories for examining the dependence of magnetic activity on rotation for stars with masses lower than \${\textbackslash}approx 1{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We present an updated study of the rotation X-ray activity relation in the two clusters. We updated membership catalogs that combine pre-Gaia catalogs with new catalogs based on Gaia Data Release 2. The resulting catalogs are the most inclusive ones for both clusters: 1739 Praesepe and 1315 Hyades stars. We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from {ROSAT}, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and {XMM}-Newton. We have detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164, respectively, have rotation periods, an increase of 6\${\textbackslash}times\$ relative to what was previously available. We find that at \${\textbackslash}approx\$700 Myr, only M dwarfs remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation. We also find a tight relation between the Rossby number and fractional X-ray luminosity \$L\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{X\}/L\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bol\}\$ in unsaturated single members, suggesting a power-law index between \$-3.2\$ and \$-3.9\$. Lastly, we find no difference in the coronal parameters between binary and single members. These results provide essential insight into the relative efficiency of magnetic heating of the stars' atmospheres, thereby informing the development of robust age-rotation-activity relations.},

Consistent dereddened colors are determined from the available photometry and temperatures are derived. Most G and K dwarfs in the Pleiades rotate slowly, but about 20 percent of the stars are ultrafast rotators ({UFRs}). That fraction of {UFRs} is independent of color, and the highest rotation rates are found among the K dwarfs. The Pleiades exhibit a broad range in the strength of chromospheric emission at any one color.

	abstract = {The coeval stars of young open clusters provide insights into the formation of the rotation-activity relationship that elude studies of multi-age field populations. We measure the chromospheric activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr old open cluster {NGC} 3532 in concert with their rotation periods to study the mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population. Using multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with the {AAOmega} spectrograph at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the chromospheric emission ratios for 454 {FGKM} cluster members of {NGC} 3532. The morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image of the cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of 'desaturated transitional rotators' that branches off from the main group of unsaturated {FGK} slow rotators, and from which it is separated by an 'activity gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the rotational gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact, the relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for many additional stars. We then precisely determine these periods from our photometric light curves. Our activity measurements show that all fast rotators of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating that the absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue but an astrophysical fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling us to populate the extended slow rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis of chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables comprehensive insights into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars during the transitional phase between the Pleiades and Hyades age.

	abstract = {We use the {LAMOST} spectra of member stars in Pleiades, M34, Praesepe, and Hyades to study how chromospheric activity varies as a function of mass and rotation at different age. We measured excess equivalent widths of H α, H β, and Ca {II} K based on estimated chromospheric contributions from old and inactive field dwarfs, and excess luminosities are obtained by normalizing bolometric luminosity, for more than 700 late-type stars in these open clusters. Results indicate two activity sequences in cool spot coverage and H α excess emission among {GK} dwarfs in Pleiades and M dwarfs in Praesepe and Hyades, paralleling with well-known rotation sequences. A weak dependence of chromospheric emission on rotation exists among ultrafast rotators in saturated regime with Rossby number Ro ≲ 0.1. In the unsaturated regime, chromospheric and coronal emission show similar dependence on Ro, but with a shift towards larger Ro, indicating chromospheric emission gets easily saturated than coronal emission, and/or convective turnover time-scales based on X-ray data do not work well with chromospheric emission. More interestingly, our analysis shows fully convective slow rotators obey the rotation-chromospheric activity relation similar to hotter stars, confirming the previous finding. We found correlations among H α, H β, and Ca {II} K emissions, in which H α losses are more important than Ca {II} K for cooler and more active stars. In addition, a weak correlation is seen between chromospheric emission and photospheric activity that shows dependence on stellar spectral type and activity level, which provides some clues on how spot configuration varies as a function of mass and activity level.},

	abstract = {Methods. Models of solar-type stars are computed including atomic diﬀusion and rotation-induced mixing with the code {STAREVOL}. We explore diﬀerent additional transport processes for chemicals and for angular momentum such as penetrative convection, tachocline mixing, and additional turbulence. We constrain the resulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation rate and 7Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters with diﬀerent ages, and the solar surface and internal rotation proﬁle as inverted from helioseismology when our models reach the age of the Sun.
Results. We show the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of 7Li in pre-main sequence and early main sequence stars. The rotational dependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation between the initial rotation rate and 7Li depletion in our models of solar-type stars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity νadd leads to eﬃcient transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope during the main sequence evolution and to solar-type models that match the observed proﬁle of the Sun. We also self-consistently compute for the ﬁrst time the thickness of the tachocline and ﬁnd that it is compatible with helioseismic estimations at the age of the Sun, but we highlight that the associated turbulence does not allow the observed 7Li depletion to be reproduced. The main sequence depletion of 7Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric turbulent mixing below the convective envelope.
Conclusions. The need for additional transport processes in stellar evolution models for both chemicals and angular momentum in addition to atomic diﬀusion, meridional circulation, and turbulent shear is conﬁrmed. We identify the rotational dependence of the penetrative convection as a key process. Two additional and distinct parametric turbulent mixing processes (one for angular momentum and one for chemicals) are required to simultaneously explain the observed surface 7Li depletion and the solar internal rotation proﬁle. We highlight the need of additional constraints for the internal rotation of young solar-type stars and also for the beryllium abundances of open clusters in order to test our predictions.},

	shorttitle = {Stellar rotation periods from K2 Campaigns 0–18},
	abstract = {Methods. We use Lomb–Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability range, Rvar, from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution.
Results. Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in 29 860 stars. The reliability of these periods was estimated from stars observed more than once. We ﬁnd that 75–90\% of the stars show period deviation smaller than 20\% between diﬀerent campaigns, depending on the peak height threshold in the periodograms. For eﬀective temperatures below 6000 K, the variability range shows a local minimum at diﬀerent periods, consistent with an isochrone age of ∼750 Myr. Additionally, the rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region in the K2 data is less pronounced compared to the Kepler ﬁeld. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum.
Conclusions. We conclude that the rotation period bimodality is present in diﬀerent ﬁelds of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability on the rotation period.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201321970},
	abstract = {Methods. Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect diﬀerent periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine ﬁt. The most dominant periods from the ﬁt were associated to diﬀerent surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting diﬀerent periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of diﬀerent periods to {DR}, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods.
Results. In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P1 between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of P1 = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 {\textless} B − V {\textless} 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P2 within ±30\% of the rotation period P1 was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to {DR} we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear α increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with eﬀective temperature. The absolute shear ΔΩ slightly increases from ΔΩ = 0.079 rad d−1 at Teﬀ = 3500 K to ΔΩ = 0.096 rad d−1 at Teﬀ = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, ΔΩ shows much larger scatter. The dependence of ΔΩ on rotation period is weak over a large period range.
Conclusions. Latitudinal diﬀerential rotation measured for the ﬁrst time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-ﬁeld theory, and seems to support these models. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias has not been fully explored, and needs to be addressed using other data, including the full Kepler time coverage.},

Results. We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with 2500 K ≤ Teﬀ ≤ 8000 K, −1 ≤ log g = log ({GM}/R2) ≤ 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, −5 ≤ [Me/H] ≤ +1, with [α/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and diﬀerent choices of C and N abundances. This includes “{CN}-cycled” models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 ≤ ξt ≤ 5 km s−1. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T , Pg, Pe, ρ, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated ﬂuxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratiﬁcation (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the eﬀects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and ﬁnd excellent agreement with planeparallel models of Castelli \& Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric {NextGen} models, the agreement with more recent {PHOENIX} models is gratifying.
Conclusions. The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate “rules of thumb” concerning eﬀects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong eﬀects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

In addition to the format adopted to store the data, the line lists are available in {MOOG}, Synspec and Turbospectrum formats. We also present a list of \$H\$-band spectral features that are either poorly represented or completely missing in our line list. This list is based on the average of a large number of spectral fit residuals for {APOGEE} observations spanning a wide range of stellar parameters.},

To understand the importance of these parameters in main-sequence stars, we have assembled a sample of observations that spans a range of these parameters using a combination of observations from The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ({TESS}) and the Kepler Space Telescope. We find that while we can measure rotation periods and identify other classes of stellar variability (e.g., pulsations) from {TESS} light curves, instrument systematics prevent the detection of rotation signals longer than the {TESS} orbital period of 13.7 days. Due to this detection limit, we also use rotation periods constrained using rotational velocities measured by the {APOGEE} spectroscopic survey and radii estimated using the Gaia mission for both {TESS} and Kepler stars. From these rotation periods, we (1) find we can track rotational evolution along discrete mass tracks as a function of stellar age, (2) find we are unable to recover trends between rotation and metallicity that were observed by previous studies, and (3) note that our sample reveals that wide binary companions do not affect rotation, while close binary companions cause stars to exhibit more rapid rotation than single stars.},

For these stars, atmospheric parameters have been derived using high-resolution spectra from the California-Kepler survey, and rotational modulation has been searched in Kepler light curves homogeneously. We fit stellar models to the atmospheric parameters, Gaia parallax, and Two Micron All Sky Survey magnitude of these stars and obtain samples drawn from the posterior probability distributions for their masses and ages under a given, uninformative prior. We combine them with the result of rotational modulation search to simultaneously infer the mass–age distribution of the sample as well as f(M ⋆, t ⋆), in a manner that fully takes into account mass and age uncertainties of individual stars. We find that f remains near unity up to t ⋆ ∼ 3 Gyr and drops to almost zero by t ⋆ ∼ 5 Gyr, although the trend is less clearly detected for stars with ≲0.9 M ⊙ due to weaker age constraints. This finding is consistent with a view that the detection of rotational modulation is limited by photometric precision to younger stars that exhibit higher-amplitude modulation, and suggests that the detectability of rotational modulation in Kepler light curves is insensitive to metallicity and activity cycles for stars younger than the Sun.},

Previous studies have shown that activity levels are largely determined by the stellar Rossby number, defined as the rotation period divided by the convective turnover time. However, we currently have little information on the role played by chemical composition. In this work, we investigate how metallicity affects magnetic activity, using photometric variability as an activity proxy. Similarly to other proxies, we demonstrate that the amplitude of photometric variability is well parameterized by the Rossby number, although in a more complex way. We also show that variability amplitude and metallicity are generally positively correlated. This trend can be understood in terms of the effect of metallicity on stellar structure, and hence the convective turnover time (or, equivalently, the Rossby number). Lastly, we demonstrate that the metallicity dependence of photometric variability results in a rotation-period detection bias, whereby the periods of metal-rich stars are more easily recovered for stars of a given mass.},

	abstract = {Aims: Previous high-precision studies of abundances of elements in solar twin stars are extended to a wider metallicity range to see how the trends of element ratios with stellar age depend on [Fe/H]. Methods: {HARPS} spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S/N ≳ 600 at λ ∼ 6000 Å were analysed with {MARCS} model atmospheres to obtain 1D {LTE} abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Sr, and Y for 72 nearby solar-type stars with metallicities in the range of -0.3 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.3 and {ASTEC} stellar models were used to determine stellar ages from effective temperatures, luminosities obtained via Gaia {DR}2 parallaxes, and heavy element abundances. Results: The age-metallicity distribution appears to consist of the following two distinct populations: a sequence of old stars with a steep rise of [Fe/H] to ∼ + 0.3 dex at an age of ∼7 Gyr and a younger sequence with [Fe/H] increasing from about -0.3 dex to ∼ + 0.2 dex over the last 6 Gyr. Furthermore, the trends of several abundance ratios, [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ni/Fe], as a function of stellar age, split into two corresponding sequences. The [Y/Mg]-age relation, on the other hand, shows no offset between the two age sequences and has no significant dependence on [Fe/H], but the components of a visual binary star, ζ Reticuli, have a large and puzzling deviation. Conclusions: The split of the age-metallicity distribution into two sequences may be interpreted as evidence of two episodes of accretion of gas onto the Galactic disk with a quenching of star formation in between. Some of the [X/Fe]-age relations support this scenario but other relations are not so easy to explain, which calls for a deeper study of systematic errors in the derived abundances as a function of [Fe/H], in particular 3D non-{LTE} effects.

	abstract = {Context. The rich open cluster M67 is known to have a chemical composition close to solar, and an age around 4 Gyr. It thus offers the opportunity to check our understanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster environment. Aims: We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution, R ≈ 50 000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among solar-like stars in M67. Methods: G dwarfs in M67 (d ≈ 900 pc) are relatively faint (V ≈ 15), which makes detailed spectroscopic studies time-consuming. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates performed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al. (2008, A\&A, 489, 677), we explore the chemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun, using {VLT}/{FLAMES}-{UVES}. Working with a solar twin in the framework of a differential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance analysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to determine the metallicity of M67. The differential approach yields precise and accurate chemical abundances for M67, which enhances the possibility to use this object in studies of the potential peculiarity, or normality, of the Sun. Results: We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters indistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall metallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H] = 0.023 ± 0.015). An age determination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 ± 1.6 Gyr. Most surprisingly, we find the chemical abundance pattern to closely resemble the solar one, in contrast to most known solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. Conclusions: We confirm the solar-twin nature of M67-1194, the first solar twin known to belong to a stellar association. This fact allows us to put some constraints on the physical reasons for the seemingly systematic departure of M67-1194 and the Sun from most known solar twins regarding chemical composition. We find that radiative dust cleansing by nearby luminous stars may be the explanation for the peculiar composition of both the Sun and M67-1194, but alternative explanations are also possible. The chemical similarity between the Sun and M67-1194 also suggests that the Sun once formed in a cluster like M67.

However, recent studies have unveiled chemical differences between the two members of binary pairs composed of Sun-like stars. These chemically inhomogeneous binaries represent one of the most contradictory examples in stellar astrophysics and a source of tension between theory and observations. It is still unclear whether the abundance variations are the result of inhomogeneities in the protostellar gas clouds or are due to planet engulfment events that occurred after the stellar formation. The former scenario undermines the general belief that the chemical makeup of stars provides the fossil information of the environment in which they formed, whereas the second scenario would shed light on the possible evolutionary paths of planetary systems. Our study provides compelling evidence in favour of the planet engulfment scenario. We also establish that planet engulfment events occur in Sun-like stars with a 20-35\% probability. Therefore, an important fraction of planetary systems undergo very dynamical evolutionary paths that critically modify their architectures, unlike our calm Solar System. This study opens the possibility of using chemical abundances of stars to identify which ones are the most likely to host Solar System analogues.},

This allows us to better assess the possible influence of planet interactions on the chemical composition of stars that are born from the same cloud and thus should have a similar abundance pattern. In our previous work, we found clear abundance differences for elements with Z ≤ 30 between both components of this system and a trend of these abundances as a function of the condensation temperature (Tc), which suggests a spectral chemical signature related to planet formation. In this work we show that our previous findings are still consistent even if we include more species, such as the volatile N and neutron capture elements (Z {\textgreater} 30). We report a slope with Tc of 1.56 ± 0.24 × 10-5 dex K-1, that is good agreement with our previous work. We also performed some tests using {ARES} and {iSpec} to measure automatically the equivalent width and found Tc slopes in reasonable agreement with our results as well. In addition, we determined abundances for Li and Be by spectral synthesis, finding that 16 Cyg A is richer not only in Li but also in Be, when compared to its companion. This may be evidence of planet engulfment, indicating that the Tc trend found in this binary system may be a chemical signature of planet accretion in the A component, rather than an imprint of the giant planet rocky core formation on 16 Cyg B.},

The effective temperature and surface gravity of 18 Sco are T eff = 5823 ± 6 K and log g = 4.45 ± 0.02 dex, i.e., 18 Sco is 46 ± 6 K hotter than the Sun and log g is 0.01 ± 0.02 dex higher. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.054 ± 0.005 dex, and its microturbulence velocity is +0.02 ± 0.01 km s-1 higher than solar. Our precise stellar parameters and differential isochrone analysis show that 18 Sco has a mass of 1.04 ± 0.02 M ⊙ and that it is {\textasciitilde}1.6 Gyr younger than the Sun. We use precise High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher ({HARPS}) radial velocities to search for planets, but none are detected. The chemical abundance pattern of 18 Sco displays a clear trend with condensation temperature, thus showing higher abundances of refractories in 18 Sco than in the Sun. Intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elements relative to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element abundance differences among nearby n-capture elements ({\textasciitilde}0.02 dex), we successfully reproduce the r-process pattern in the Solar System. This is independent evidence for the universality of the r process. Our results have important implications for chemical tagging in our Galaxy and nucleosynthesis in general.

For each planet host, we identify a set of comparison stars and examine the abundance differences (corrected for Galactic chemical evolution effect) as a function of the dust condensation temperature, Tcond, of the individual elements. While we confirm that the Sun exhibits a negative trend between abundance and Tcond, we also confirm that the remaining planet hosts exhibit a variety of abundance-Tcond trends with no clear dependence upon age, metallicity, or Teff. The diversity in the chemical compositions of planet-hosting stars relative to their comparison stars could reflect the range of possible planet-induced effects present in these planet hosts, from the sequestration of rocky material (refractory poor) to the possible ingestion of planets (refractory rich). Other possible explanations include differences in the time-scale, efficiency and degree of planet formation, or inhomogeneous chemical evolution. Although we do not find an unambiguous chemical signature of planet formation among our sample, the high-precision chemical abundances of the host stars are essential for constraining the composition and structure of their exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Observations of Sun-like stars over the past half-century have improved our understanding of how magnetic dynamos, like that responsible for the 11 yr solar cycle, change with rotation, mass, and age. Here we show for the first time how metallicity can affect a stellar dynamo. Using the most complete set of observations of a stellar cycle ever obtained for a Sun-like star, we show how the solar analog {HD} 173701 exhibits solar-like differential rotation and a 7.4 yr activity cycle. While the duration of the cycle is comparable to that generated by the solar dynamo, the amplitude of the brightness variability is substantially stronger. The only significant difference between {HD} 173701 and the Sun is its metallicity, which is twice the solar value. Therefore, this provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability. The observations can be explained by the higher metallicity of the star, which is predicted to foster a deeper outer convection zone and a higher facular contrast, resulting in stronger variability.},

	abstract = {Context. The study of stellar activity is important because it can provide new constraints for dynamo models when combined with surface rotation rates and the depth of the convection zone. We know that the dynamo mechanism, which is believed to be the main process that rules the magnetic cycle of solar-like stars, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation, convection, and magnetic field. The Kepler mission has already been collecting data for a large number of stars during four years allowing us to investigate magnetic stellar cycles. Aims: We investigated the Kepler light curves to look for magnetic activity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. Based on the photometric data we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magnetic activity of the stars. Methods: We selected a sample of 22 solar-like F stars that have a rotation period shorter than 12 days. We performed a time-frequency analysis using the Morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy for our sample of stars. We computed the magnetic index Sph as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index ⟨ Sph ⟩, which is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of length five times the rotation period of the star. We defined new indicators, such as the contrast between high and low activity, to take into account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for all the stars. We also inferred the Rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background. Results: This analysis shows different types of behaviour in the 22 F stars. Two stars show behaviour very similar to magnetic activity cycles. Five stars show long-lived spots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. Two stars in our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in the temporal variation of the magnetic proxies. Finally, the last group of stars shows magnetic activity (with the presence of spots) but no sign of cycle. Appendix A is available in electronic fom at http://www.aanda.org},

	abstract = {The Sun and stars with low magnetic activity levels, become photometrically brighter when their activity increases. Magnetically more active stars display the opposite behaviour and get fainter when their activity increases. We reproduce the observed photometric trends in stellar variations with a model that treats stars as hypothetical Suns with coverage by magnetic features different from that of the Sun. The presented model attributes the variability of stellar spectra to the imbalance between the contributions from different components of the solar atmosphere, such as dark starspots and bright faculae. A stellar spectrum is calculated from spectra of the individual components, by weighting them with corresponding disc area coverages. The latter are obtained by extrapolating the solar dependences of spot and facular disc area coverages on chromospheric activity to stars with different levels of mean chromospheric activity. We have found that the contribution by starspots to the variability increases faster with chromospheric activity than the facular contribution. This causes the transition from faculae-dominated variability and direct activity--brightness correlation to spot-dominated variability and inverse activity--brightness correlation with increasing chromospheric activity level. We have shown that the regime of the variability also depends on the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the line-of-sight and on the latitudinal distribution of active regions on the stellar surface. Our model can be used as a tool to extrapolate the observed photometric variability of the Sun to Sun-like stars at different activity levels, which makes possible the direct comparison between solar and stellar irradiance data.},

Since no direct information on the radiation field is available, empirical relations between signatures of stellar activity, including the sizes and magnetic fields of starspots, are often used.

	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stz3197},
	abstract = {The association of star-spots with magnetic fields leads to an expectation that quantities which correlate with magnetic field strength may also correlate with star-spot coverage. Since younger stars spin faster and are more magnetically active, assessing whether star-spot coverage correlates with shorter rotation periods and stellar youth tests these principles. Here, we analyse the star-spot covering fraction versus stellar age for M-, G-, K-, and F-type stars based on previously determined variability and rotation periods of over 30 000 Kepler main-sequence stars. We determine the correlation between age and variability using single and dual power-law best fits. We find that star-spot coverage does indeed decrease with age. Only when the data are binned in an effort to remove the effects of activity cycles of individual stars, do statistically significant power-law fits emerge for each stellar type. Using bin averages, we then find that the star-spot covering fraction scales with the X-ray to bolometric ratio to the power λ with 0.22 ± 0.03 {\textless} λ {\textless} 0.32 ± 0.09 for G-type stars of rotation period below 15 d and for the full range of F- and M-type stars. For K-type stars, we find two branches of λ separated by variability bins, with the lower branch showing nearly constant star-spot coverage and the upper branch λ ∼ 0.35 ± 0.04. G-type stars with periods longer than 15 d exhibit a transition to steeper power law of λ ∼ 2.4 ± 1.0. The potential connection to previous rotation-age measurements suggesting a magnetic breaking transition at the solar age, corresponding to period of 24.5 is also of interest.},

	abstract = {Secular changes brought about by tidal friction in the solar system are reviewed. The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 {\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater4{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the dynamical problem of tidal friction in a binary system consisting of deformable components, with the restriction that the angle of lag or advance of the tidal distortion with respect to the direction of the disturbing companion is small. The fractional distortion of the bodies due to rotation and tidal interaction is also treated as a first-order small quantity, and terms up to the fourth harmonic in the tidal potential are retained. In this linear approximation, the time-dependent tidal potential can be Fourier decomposed into a spectrum of simple harmonic terms, each of which is responsible for raising a `partial wave' in the body; each such partial wave can then be treated independently of the others. This is the method first employed by Darwin. In Section 2, it is assumed that the phase lag in the response of the body (due to dissipation of kinetic energy of deformation) is proportional to the forcing frequency, which is justified for small amplitude oscillations of a viscous fluid or visco-elastic body. A simple expression is then obtained for the potential function for the distortion in terms of the disturbing potential and the structure of the body. In Section 3, the distortion potential function is employed in deriving the {componentsR}, S {andW} of the disturbing force which are then substituted in the Gaussian form of the equations for variation of the elements. In Section 4, the Eulerian equations for motion of deformable bodies are derived, using the so-called `mean axes' of the body as the rotating axes of reference. In Section 5, it is shown that the dynamical effects of rotational distortion occur on a much shorter time scale than those arising from tidal friction, which allows one to consider the two phenomena as acting independently of one another. The collected set of Gaussian (orbital) and Eulerian (body) equations is re-written in terms of dimensionless variables for the tidal friction case, and the stability of the system is examined on the basis of these equations. In Section 6, the tidal friction equations are integrated numerically for the close binary system {AG} Persei and for the Earth-Moon system. In the former, the integrations were started from a highly elliptical orbit and the system was found to relax into a circular orbit, with synchronous rotation perpendicular to the orbit. In the latter, the integrations were performed backwards in time from the present day, and it was found that the lunar orbit rapidly becomes highly elliptical at the time of closest approach, thus indicating a probable capture of the Moon by the Earth. This result is in agreement with that obtained by other investigators; however, it is shown that the detailed behaviour of the system at the time of capture, in particular the inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic, depends critically on the chosen rate of dissipation in the Moon's interior. A simple argument is presented which allows an estimation for the mean viscosity of a fluid body from the known age of the system: for the components of {AG} per, the result is 2×10{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater11{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater g cm{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater s{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater, indicating that the stars must have possessed turbulent convective outer regions during some part of their tidal evolution, while for the Earth, the result, is 1.4×10{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater12{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater g cm{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater s{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater. It is shown that the angle of tidal lag in nonsynchronous close binary systems in general is expected to be extremely small, and not observationally detectable.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of meridional circulation in the radiative zone of a rotating star has been studied. The Eddington-Sweet formulation of the circulation velocity, in which the convective transport of energy by the flow is assumed to compensate for the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux, is confirmed for a "slowly" rotating star. On the other hand, apparent singularities of the circulation velocity in the case = a and near the stellar surface are found to be due to improper uses of the Eddington-Sweet formulation. When the convective transport of energy is inefficient, the energy equation reduces to the thermal conduction equation, in which the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux results in local heating or cooling, and the star manages ot redistribute angular velocity of rotation in such a way that there is no meridional circulation. The Goldreich-Schubert instability destroys the above-mentioned steady rotation, but it is argued that a new steady state is likely to be established in which a balance exists between the meridional circulation and the irregular motion due to this instability.

We find that half of the rapidly rotating stars are confirmed or candidate binary systems. The remaining fast rotators have not been searched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We previously found that nearly all rapidly rotating stars in the Hyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different Prot distributions. We also compare the observed Prot distribution in Praesepe to that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe the clear bimodal Prot distribution predicted by Brown for \&gt;0.5 stars at the age of Praesepe, but 0.25−0.5 stars do show stronger bimodality. In addition, we find that \&gt;60\% of early M dwarfs in Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al., which suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to solar-type stars and fully convective stars. The incompleteness of surveys for binaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models since the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single stars.},

It also helps to set constraints for cosmological models. The presence of very strong lithium lines in some giant stars of different spectral types and stages of evolution has been considered up to the end of the nineties as a puzzle. To solve this problem, non standard evolutionary mechanisms must be invoked. We review here all the mechanisms presented in the literature and which are divided into internal and external processes of lithium enrichment. We will also discuss the observational tests which are being performed in order to discard (or not) some of them. In any case, the more realistic values of the lithium abundances in giants are, as we will see, the main test of these proposed scenarios. Because of this importance we discuss here the state of art of the Non-{LTE} determinations of lithium abundances in strong lithium giants. Evolved giants, with lithium abundances larger than that of the interstellar medium and with their important mass losses can be considered the most realistic sources of lithium in the Galaxy. We believe that a complete physical picture of this problem will give a powerful tool to understand the chemical evolution of a large part of all light elements.},

The interior and envelope solutions in this procedure are derived in Sections 2 and 3. The results apply to stars which have a convective core and a radiative envelope, and they are discussed in Section 4. We find that the resonances of the free gravity modes are damped by radiative dissipation, which operates in a relatively thin region below the surface of the star. Due to that dissipation, some properties of the dynamical tide have observable consequences in close binary systems: (1) A torque is applied to a binary component; this serves to make it corotate with its companion in a time which can be short compared to its nuclear life. (2) Before that synchronization is achieved, the brightness distribution over the surface of the star is in general phase shifted relative to the external driving potential.},

An elementary derivation is presented of the perturbing tidal forces, and the perturbations are used to derive differential equations for the evolution of several orbital and rotational parameters of the binary system. Energy and angular momentum considerations are used directly instead of the general perturbation techniques of celestial mechanics. The tidal evolution equations are analyzed locally around equilibrium configurations. Time scales are derived for the rate of change of the semimajor axis, the rotational velocity, and for the eccentricity and inclination, which go to zero asymptotically. The global aspects of the tidal evolution equations are analyzed. For the case of small inclinations but arbitrary eccentricity, a complete classification is made of all types of tidal evolution possible in the model which is presented. Several relations are obtained analytically from the equations for tidal evolution in the weak friction model. The presented model is simple, but it is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide class of binary stars},

	abstract = {We use Doppler imaging techniques to determine the dependence of starspot rotation rates on latitude in an homogeneous sample of young, rapidly rotating solar analogues. A solar-like differential rotation law is used, where the rotation depends on sin2θ, where θ is the stellar latitude. By including this term in the image reconstruction process, using starspots as tracers, we are able to determine the magnitude of the shear over more than one rotation cycle. We also consider results from matched filter starspot tracking techniques, where individual starspot rotation rates are determined. In addition we have re-analysed published results and present a new measurement for the K3 dwarf Speedy Mic.A total of 10 stars of spectral type G2—M2 are considered. We find a trend towards decreasing surface differential rotation with decreasing effective temperature. The implied approach to solid body rotation with increasing relative convection zone depth implies that the dynamo mechanism operating in low-mass stars may be substantially different from that in the Sun.},

	abstract = {Models of stellar evolution with rotation are very much needed in order to interpret recent stellar properties, in particular for massive stars. For that we proceed to a detailed investigation of some critical physical processes in rotating stars: 1. The equation expressing the transport of angular momentum by circulation and diffusion is revised to also account for expansion and contraction in non-stationary models. 2. We examine the current expressions for the velocity U(r) of the meridional circulation, also taking into account mu -gradients and horizontal turbulence. We show that there are no “mu -currents” but just meridional currents which can be sizeably influenced by the gradients of mean molecular weight mu . A proper account of the mu -gradients may reduce U(r) by one or two orders of magnitude with respect to current expressions. 3. While the usual expressions for the meridional circulation would predict an infinite velocity at the edge of a radiative and semiconvective zone and an inverted circulation in a semiconvective zone, the present developments give a continuity of the solutions for the circulation. 4. The approximation of a stationary circulation, which is no longer valid after the main-sequence phase, is also removed and the case of a general equation of state is considered. We notice that in the stationary regime the horizontal fluctuations of mu represent some fixed fraction of the vertical mu -gradient. To first order, this fraction is not dependent on rotation, because the building of horizontal fluctuations by the circulation is compensated by the smoothing due to horizontal turbulence.},

	abstract = {The author examines the interaction between meridian circulation and turbulence in rotating, non-magnetic stars. The turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, with stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical, thereby enforcing a rotation rate which depends only on depth, to first approximation. This conjecture is supported by the interior rotation of the Sun, which is now being revealed through acoustic sounding. The main result is that both the meridian circulation and the turbulence are determined by the loss of angular momentum, which the author ascribes here solely to a stellar wind. When there is no wind, the meridian flow is very weak, and it can even vanish in slow rotators. When the wind is active, it drives the circulation in order to transport angular momentum to the surface, but the advection of chemical species by this flow is partly inhibited because of the horizontal turbulence.},

The sliding instabffity controls the -domains, and shear instabffities control the Q-domains. The boundaries between these domains are narrow and variable. An enhanced Eddington.Sweet current flows in the boundary regions, and we calculate the resulting mean flux of angniar momentum. In most circumstances, this flux is of the same order as the normal Eddington-Sweet flux, and the appropriate time-scale for large-scale redistribution of angular momentum is therefore the Eddington-Sweet timescale. Key words: stellar rotation - Goldreich-Schubert instabfflty - non-linear limiting - shear instabffities - Eddington.Sweet current},

	abstract = {Double-lined eclipsing binaries with accurate absolute dimensions are the best stellar data to test tidal evolution theories due to the high dependency of the time scales on masses, relative radii and periods. In a preceding paper we have probed the hydrodynamical mechanism against the observed levels of synchronization and circularization for about 40 close binary systems with accurate absolute dimensions. In the present work we extend our investigations, using the same systems as a control, to the turbulent dissipation and radiative damping mechanisms which have been studied by Zahn. The time scales for these processes are characterized by the parameters λ\_2\_ and E\_2\_ respectively. These parameters were computed for a wide grid of stellar models and they are presented, for the first time, as functions of the mass and time. The differential equations which govern the orbital parameters were integrated using our recent grids of stellar models (Claret 1995A\&amp;{AS}..109..441C, 1997, A\&amp;{AS} submitted; Claret \&amp; Gimenez 1995A\&amp;A...296..180C, 1995A\&amp;{AS}..114..549C). The derived critical times and radii were compared with observations of synchronization and circularization levels. Within uncertainties, the formalisms by Zahn seem to be able to explain the eccentricity distribution around the zero point of the diagram log (age/t\_cri\_) x eccentricity although they can not explain some systems with circular orbits which present ages smaller than their respective critical times. We have also introduced a diagram based on the integration of the differential equations which proved to be useful to test theoretical predictions for the relationship age x Period (cut-off) for clusters. Using this diagram we have shown that the turbulent friction mechanism is not dissipative enough to explain such an observational relationship. However, as these results are valid only for little departure from synchronism and small eccentricity, we plan to investigate the influence of the initial conditions in a forthcoming paper.},

We find that differentially rotating solar models, such as the one proposed by Dicke, are unstable. The rate of turbulent diffusion in the unstable regions of these models is so rapid that it appears to preclude a fast-spinning solar interior. As a corollary of the stability analysis, we conclude that the loss of a significant fraction of a star's angular momentum must be accompanied by the mixing of material below its convective zone. Such mixing inevitably leads to the depletion of lithium in the star's photosphere.},

It is demonstrated that most of the orbital circularization occurs during the Hayashi phase, and that the subsequent decrease in eccentricity on the main-sequence is negligible. The theoretical cutoff period, which separates the circular from the eccentric systems, lies between 7.2 and 8.5 days, depending on the masses and on the assumptions made about the initial conditions; it agrees well with the observed period of about 8 days. This cutoff period is a function of the initial radius of the stars on the Hayashi track. In these calculations, the values predicted by the star formation theory of Stahler et al. (1980) are used; hence the good agreement mentioned above provides a new validation of that theory. It is also shown that systems around that cutoff period reach the zero-age main-sequence with their components rotating faster than the orbital rate.},

	abstract = {Many stars exhibit strong magnetic fields, some of which are thought to be of primordial origin and others a sign of magnetic dynamo processes. We briefly review the results of observational studies of solar-type stars seeking to evaluate the linkage between rotation rate and possible magnetic cycles of activity. Clearly turbulent convection and rotation within spherical shell geometries provide ingredients essential for dynamo action. However, intensive efforts over several decades in solar research have demonstrated that it is no easy matter to achieve cyclic magnetic activity that is in accord with observations. Helioseismology has revealed that an essential element for the global solar dynamo is the presence of a tachocline of shear at the base of the solar convection zone, leading to the likely operation of an interface dynamo. We review the crucial elements for achieving a cyclic magnetic activity. We then discuss some of our current 3 D {MHD} simulations of solar turbulent convection in spherical shells that yield differential rotation profiles which make good contact with some of the helioseismic findings.

	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, five appear to be Li-rich because they have not completed the standard first dredge-up dilution, and three have abundances compatible with the maximum allowed by standard dilution. Thus, these should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. At this evolutionary phase, the outwardly-moving hydrogen shell burns through the mean molecular weight discontinuity created by the first dredge-up. Any extra-mixing process can now easily connect the {\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater3{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterHe}-rich envelope material to the outer regions of the hydrogen-burning shell, enabling Li production by the Cameron \&amp; Fowler (1971) process. While very high Li abundances are then reached, this Li-rich phase is extremely short lived because once the mixing extends deep enough to lower the carbon isotopic ratio below the standard dilution value, the freshly synthesized Li is quickly destroyed. In intermediate-mass stars, the mean molecular weight gradient due to the first dredge-up is not erased until after the star has begun to burn helium in its core. The Li-rich phase in these stars occurs when the convective envelope deepens at the base of the {AGB}, permitting extra-mixing to play an effective role. Li production ceases when a strong mean molecular weight gradient is built up between the deepening convective envelope and the shell of nuclear burning that surrounds the inert {CO} core. This episode is also very short lived. Low-mass stars may undergo additional mixing at this phase. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

	abstract = {The plethora of photometric data collected by the Kepler space telescope has promoted the detection of tens of thousands of stellar rotation periods. However, these periods are not found to an equal extent among different spectral types. Interestingly, early G-type stars with near-solar rotation periods are strongly underrepresented among those stars with known rotation periods. In this study we investigate whether the small number of such stars can be explained by difficulties in the period determination from photometric time series. For that purpose, we generate model light curves of early G-type stars with solar rotation periods for different inclination angles, metallicities, and (magnitude-dependent) noise levels. We find that the detectability is determined by the predominant type of activity (i.e., spot or faculae domination) on the surface, which defines the degree of irregularity of the light curve, and further depends on the level of photometric noise. These two effects significantly complicate the period detection and explain the lack of solar-like stars with known near-solar rotation periods. We conclude that the rotation periods of the majority of solar-like stars with near-solar rotation periods remain undetected to date. Finally, we promote the use of new techniques to recover more periods of near-solar rotators.},

	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 12 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M \&gt;{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 40 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater and fast rotation, a bluewards “homogeneous-like” track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Lyu96\}).},

	abstract = {Monitoring chromospheric and photospheric indexes of magnetic activity can provide valuable information, especially the interaction between different parts of the atmosphere and their response to magnetic fields. We extract chromospheric indexes, S and Rhk+, for 59,816 stars from {LAMOST} spectra in the {LAMOST}-Kepler program, and photospheric index, Reff, for 5575 stars from Kepler light curves. The log Reff shows positive correlation with log Rhk+. We estimate the power-law indexes between Reff and Rhk+ for F-, G-, and K-type stars, respectively. We also confirm the dependence of both chromospheric and photospheric activity on stellar rotation. Ca {II} H and K emissions and photospheric variations generally decrease with increasing rotation periods for stars with rotation periods exceeding a few days. The power-law indexes in exponential decay regimes show different characteristics in the two activity-rotation relations. The updated largest sample including the activity proxies and reported rotation periods provides more information to understand the magnetic activity for cool stars.},

	abstract = {In the last 15 years different ground-based spectroscopic surveys have been started (and completed) with the general aim of delivering stellar parameters and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic stars, complementing Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-{ESO} Public Spectroscopic Survey ({GES}), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target 100,000 stars using {FLAMES} on the {ESO} {VLT} (both Giraffe and {UVES} spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on open star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.) reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data reduction, organisation, and workflow. The {GES} has determined homogeneous good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of its more than 110,000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived for up to 31 elements for targets observed with {UVES}. Lithium abundances are delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been addressed by the Gaia-{ESO} consortium and the community, with many highlight results achieved. The final catalogue has been released through the {ESO} archive at the end of May 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products. In addition to these results, the Gaia-{ESO} Survey will leave a very important legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.},

	abstract = {Methods. The most recent version of the {MARCS} program is used. Results. We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with 2500 K ≤ Teff ≤ 8000 K, −1 ≤ log g = log ({GM}/R2) ≤ 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, −5 ≤ [Me/H] ≤ +1, with [α/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances. This includes “{CN}-cycled” models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 ≤ ξt ≤ 5 km s−1. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T , Pg, Pe, ρ, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and find excellent agreement with planeparallel models of Castelli \& Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric {NextGen} models, the agreement with more recent {PHOENIX} models is gratifying. Conclusions. The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate “rules of thumb” concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

Multiple linear regression to estimate the nitrogen abundance combined with principal components analysis, after addressing the incomplete and truncated nature of the data, reveals that the effective temperature and the frequency of the dominant acoustic oscillation mode are the only two significant predictors for the nitrogen abundance, while the projected rotational velocity and the rotational frequency have no predictive power. The dominant gravity mode and the magnetic field strength are correlated with the effective temperature but have no predictive power for the nitrogen abundance.

Each quarter (Q1–Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally, the full time series and their different segments are analyzed. Results. For more than 18 500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from {McQuillan} et al. (2014, {ApJS}, 211, 24). Of these, more than 12 300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as {DR}. Dependencies of the {DR} with rotation period and effective temperature could be confirmed, e.g., the relative {DR} increases with rotation period. Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17 000 stars using different gyrochronology relations, most of them with uncertainties dominated by period variations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between 3200–4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. Conclusions. The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than ∼93.0\% of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The relation between activity and age is interesting, and requires further investigation. The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable.},

Understanding how stars rotate is central to modelling their structure, formation and evolution, and how they interact with their environment and companion stars. This authoritative volume, first published in 2000, provides a lucid introduction to stellar rotation and the definitive reference to the subject. It combines theory and observation in a comprehensive survey of how the rotation of stars affects the structure and evolution of the Sun, single stars and close binaries. This book will be of primary interest to graduate students and researchers studying solar and stellar rotation and close binary systems. It will also appeal to those with a more general interest in solar and stellar physics, star formation, binary stars and the hydrodynamics of rotating fluids - including geophysicists, planetary scientists and plasma physicists.},

	abstract = {Methods. We reanalyze a previously studied sample of 24 124 Kepler stars using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Each quarter (Q1–Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally, the full time series and their different segments are analyzed. Results. For more than 18 500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from {McQuillan} et al. (2014, {ApJS}, 211, 24). Of these, more than 12 300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as {DR}. Dependencies of the {DR} with rotation period and effective temperature could be confirmed, e.g., the relative {DR} increases with rotation period. Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17 000 stars using different gyrochronology relations, most of them with uncertainties dominated by period variations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between 3200–4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. Conclusions. The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than ∼93.0\% of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The relation between activity and age is interesting, and requires further investigation. The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable.},

	abstract = {Methods. Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were associated to different surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting different periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of different periods to {DR}, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods. Results. In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P1 between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of P1 = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 {\textbackslash}textless B − V {\textbackslash}textless 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P2 within {\textbackslash}pm30\% of the rotation period P1 was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to {DR} we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear α increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear ΔΩ slightly increases from ΔΩ = 0.079 rad d−1 at Teff = 3500 K to ΔΩ = 0.096 rad d−1 at Teff = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, ΔΩ shows much larger scatter. The dependence of ΔΩ on rotation period is weak over a large period range. Conclusions. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory, and seems to support these models. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias has not been fully explored, and needs to be addressed using other data, including the full Kepler time coverage.},

	abstract = {Methods. We use Lomb–Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability range, Rvar, from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution. Results. Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in 29 860 stars. The reliability of these periods was estimated from stars observed more than once. We find that 75–90\% of the stars show period deviation smaller than 20\% between different campaigns, depending on the peak height threshold in the periodograms. For effective temperatures below 6000 K, the variability range shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of ∼750 Myr. Additionally, the rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region in the K2 data is less pronounced compared to the Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. Conclusions. We conclude that the rotation period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability on the rotation period.},

We explore different additional transport processes for chemicals and for angular momentum such as penetrative convection, tachocline mixing, and additional turbulence. We constrain the resulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation rate and 7Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters with different ages, and the solar surface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology when our models reach the age of the Sun. Results. We show the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of 7Li in pre-main sequence and early main sequence stars. The rotational dependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation between the initial rotation rate and 7Li depletion in our models of solar-type stars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity νadd leads to efficient transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope during the main sequence evolution and to solar-type models that match the observed profile of the Sun. We also self-consistently compute for the first time the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is compatible with helioseismic estimations at the age of the Sun, but we highlight that the associated turbulence does not allow the observed 7Li depletion to be reproduced. The main sequence depletion of 7Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric turbulent mixing below the convective envelope. Conclusions. The need for additional transport processes in stellar evolution models for both chemicals and angular momentum in addition to atomic diffusion, meridional circulation, and turbulent shear is confirmed. We identify the rotational dependence of the penetrative convection as a key process. Two additional and distinct parametric turbulent mixing processes (one for angular momentum and one for chemicals) are required to simultaneously explain the observed surface 7Li depletion and the solar internal rotation profile. We highlight the need of additional constraints for the internal rotation of young solar-type stars and also for the beryllium abundances of open clusters in order to test our predictions.},

We measured excess equivalent widths of H α, H β, and Ca {II} K based on estimated chromospheric contributions from old and inactive field dwarfs, and excess luminosities are obtained by normalizing bolometric luminosity, for more than 700 late-type stars in these open clusters. Results indicate two activity sequences in cool spot coverage and H α excess emission among {GK} dwarfs in Pleiades and M dwarfs in Praesepe and Hyades, paralleling with well-known rotation sequences. A weak dependence of chromospheric emission on rotation exists among ultrafast rotators in saturated regime with Rossby number Ro ≲ 0.1. In the unsaturated regime, chromospheric and coronal emission show similar dependence on Ro, but with a shift towards larger Ro, indicating chromospheric emission gets easily saturated than coronal emission, and/or convective turnover time-scales based on X-ray data do not work well with chromospheric emission. More interestingly, our analysis shows fully convective slow rotators obey the rotation-chromospheric activity relation similar to hotter stars, confirming the previous finding. We found correlations among H α, H β, and Ca {II} K emissions, in which H α losses are more important than Ca {II} K for cooler and more active stars. In addition, a weak correlation is seen between chromospheric emission and photospheric activity that shows dependence on stellar spectral type and activity level, which provides some clues on how spot configuration varies as a function of mass and activity level.},

	abstract = {Rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, with far reaching consequences for stellar evolution. Nitrogen surface abundances for a large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the {LMC} were obtained by the {VLT}-{FLAMES} Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a broad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough sample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis. We use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of rotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution models, using the {FLAMES} sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing processes. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid to simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational velocity distributions consistent with those from the {FLAMES} sample. The synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results and theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars without significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators with enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally. Furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical processes appear to be required to understand the population of massive main-sequence stars from the {FLAMES} sample.We discuss the possible role of binary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary systems},

	abstract = {The coeval stars of young open clusters provide insights into the formation of the rotation-activity relationship that elude studies of multi-age field populations. We measure the chromospheric activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr old open cluster {NGC} 3532 in concert with their rotation periods to study the mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population. Using multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with the {AAOmega} spectrograph at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the chromospheric emission ratios for 454 {FGKM} cluster members of {NGC} 3532. The morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image of the cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of 'desaturated transitional rotators' that branches off from the main group of unsaturated {FGK} slow rotators, and from which it is separated by an 'activity gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the rotational gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact, the relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for many additional stars. We then precisely determine these periods from our photometric light curves. Our activity measurements show that all fast rotators of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating that the absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue but an astrophysical fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling us to populate the extended slow rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis of chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables comprehensive insights into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars during the transitional phase between the Pleiades and Hyades age.

	abstract = {Stars between two and three solar masses rotate rapidly on the main sequence, and the detection of slow core and surface rotation in the core-helium burning phase for these stars places strong constraints on their angular momentum transport and loss. From a detailed asteroseismic study of the mixed-dipole mode pattern in a carefully selected, representative sample of stars, we find that slow core rotation rates in the range reported by prior studies are a general phenomenon and not a selection effect. We show that the core rotation rates of these stars decline strongly with decreasing surface gravity during the core He-burning phase. We argue that this is a model-independent indication of significant rapid angular momentum transport between the cores and envelopes of these stars. We see a significant range in core rotation rates at all surface gravities, with little evidence for a convergence towards a uniform value. We demonstrate using evolutionary models that measured surface rotation periods are a biased tracer of the true surface rotation distribution, and argue for using stellar models for interpreting the contrast between core and surface rotation rates. The core rotation rates we measure do not have a strong mass or metallicity dependence. We argue that the emerging data strongly favors a model where angular momentum transport is much more efficient during the core He burning phase than in the shell burning phases which precede and follow it.},

Praesepe and the Hyades, two of the nearest, most-studied open clusters, are among the best available laboratories for examining the dependence of magnetic activity on rotation for stars with masses lower than \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 1{\textbackslash}textbackslash M\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot\}{\textbackslash}. We present an updated study of the rotation X-ray activity relation in the two clusters. We updated membership catalogs that combine pre-Gaia catalogs with new catalogs based on Gaia Data Release 2. The resulting catalogs are the most inclusive ones for both clusters: 1739 Praesepe and 1315 Hyades stars. We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from {ROSAT}, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and {XMM}-Newton. We have detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164, respectively, have rotation periods, an increase of 6\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes{\textbackslash} relative to what was previously available. We find that at \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}700 Myr, only M dwarfs remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation. We also find a tight relation between the Rossby number and fractional X-ray luminosity {\textbackslash}L\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{X\}/L\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{bol\}{\textbackslash} in unsaturated single members, suggesting a power-law index between {\textbackslash}-3.2{\textbackslash} and {\textbackslash}-3.9{\textbackslash}. Lastly, we find no difference in the coronal parameters between binary and single members. These results provide essential insight into the relative efficiency of magnetic heating of the stars' atmospheres, thereby informing the development of robust age-rotation-activity relations.},

We have selected a sample of 259 dwarfs in the B-V range 0.5-2.0, including 110 field stars and 149 members of the Pleiades, Hyades, alpha Persei, {IC} 2602 and {IC} 2391 open clusters. All the stars have been observed with {ROSAT}, and most of them have photometrically-measured rotation periods available. Our results confirm that two emission regimes exist, one in which the rotation period is a good predictor of the total X-ray luminosity, and the other in which a constant saturated X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is attained; we present a quantitative estimate of the critical rotation periods below which stars of different masses (or spectral types) enter the saturated regime.

It is suggested that the outward-streaming gas draws out the lines of force of the solar magnetic fields so that near the sun the field is very nearly in a radial direction.

The solution must pass through three critical points, whose significance is explained in terms of the characteristic velocities with which disturbances propagate. A numerical solution is obtained for typical parameters The magnetic field produces only a modest tendency toward co-rotation of the outer corona, but the magnetic stresses apply a torque to the Sun equal to that required to produce effective co-rotation out to the radial distance where the radial Mach number equals unity. For typical solar-wind values this will occur between 15 and 50 solar radii out, which implies a substantial loss in the angular momentum of the Sun.},

The absolute {AMRI}, unlike the convective one, stays in the device, displaying a sustained growth that can be experimentally detected. We also study the global {AMRI} in a {TC} flow of finite height using {DNS} and find that its emerging butterfly-type structure – a spatio-temporal variation in the form of upward and downward traveling waves – is in a very good agreement with the linear stability analysis, which indicates the presence of two dominant absolute {AMRI} modes in the flow giving rise to this global butterfly pattern.},

The average space velocity of a normal star in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.},

One of the explanations that have been proposed is that a primordial magnetic field renders the rotation uniform in the radiation zone. We test here the validity of this magnetic scenario through 3D numerical {MHD} simulations that encompass both the radiation zone and the convection zone. The numerical simulations are performed with the anelastic spherical harmonics ({ASH}) code. The computational domain extends from {\textbackslash}0.07{\textbackslash}textbackslash;R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash} to {\textbackslash}0.97{\textbackslash}textbackslash;R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}. In the parameter regime we explored, a dipolar fossil field aligned with the rotation axis can not remain confined in the radiation zone. When the field lines are allowed to interact with turbulent unstationary convective motions at the base of the convection zone, 3D effects prevent the field confinement. In agreement with previous work, we find that a dipolar fossil field, even when it is initially buried deep inside the radiation zone, will spread into the convective zone. According to Ferraro's law of iso-rotation, it then imprints on the radiation zone the latitudinal differential rotation of the convection zone, which is not observed.},

There is a thin transition layer between these zones, called the tachocline4. This structure has been measured seismologically1,2,3, but no purely fluid-dynamical mechanism can explain its existence. Here we argue that a self-consistent model requires a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun's interior, as well as consideration of the Coriolis effects in the convection zone and in the tachocline. Turbulent stresses in the convection zone induce (through Coriolis effects) a meridional circulation, causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards, thereby generating the horizontal and vertical shear that characterizes the tachocline. The interior magnetic field stops the burrowing, and confines the shear, as demanded by the observed structure of the tachocline. We outline a dynamical theory of the flow, from which we estimate a field strength of about 10−4 tesla just beneath the tachocline. An important test of this picture, after numerical refinement, will be quantitative consistency between the predicted and observed interior angular velocities.},

This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, {LX} /L {bolvpropRoβ}, is fit as β = -2.70 {\textbackslash}pm 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = -2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/Ω{vpropΩ}0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro {\textbackslash}textless 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

	abstract = {Aims: We study the evolution of stellar rotation and wind properties for low-mass main-sequence stars. Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to constrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their properties evolve with time on the main-sequence. Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed rotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence. Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstar {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ2 {\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ\{1.33\} M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ\{-3.36\}{\textbackslash}. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age. Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. In particular, the decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B sugergiants can now be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines. Including a centrifugal force (in the equatorial plane) decreases the terminal velocity and increases the massloss rate, but neither effect is measurable in current data.},

The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. The decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B supergiants can be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines.},

	abstract = {We continue our study of a powerful weak-field {MHD} instability. Consequences of the instability for pressure-supported systems are discussed, with emphasis upon stellar radiative zones. It is suggested that the instability, rather than hydromagnetic waves, is responsible for establishing uniform rotation in weakly magnetized stellar radiative zones. When the Brunt–Väisälä frequency much exceeds the rotation frequency, only displacements in spherical shells are unstable. Thus the transport induced by the instability is tangential and leads to little radial mixing. If angular velocity is initially constant on cylinders, the effect of the instability is to transport angular momentum from the poles to the equator. If angular momentum is locally deposited by thermalization of the instability, this will probably have the effect of establishing solid-body rotation in radiative zones. If angular momentum is not deposited locally, it will tend to accumulate in the mid-plane of the star, with uncertain consequences. It may contribute to an anisotropic wind. A review of the instability in discs is also presented.},

	abstract = {We show that the Richardson criterion, even in its improved form found recently, is insufficient by itself to describe the occurrence of shear instabilities in rotating stars. The coupling between the shears and their effects on the T-gradient must be accounted for. When this is done, we obtain a new more complete criterion, in which the shear properties essentially depend on one critical dimensionless number θ. We must distinguish the cases of radiative and semiconvective zones. For a radiative zone, the stability criterion becomes (1)/(4) (({dU})/(dz))ˆ2ˆ{\textbackslash}textless(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_). If this condition is not realized, we show that there is always a range of scales in the turbulent spectrum where shear instabilities occur. The corresponding diffusion coefficient, depending only on θ, is given. In a semiconvective zone, the stability criterion, with respect to shears, is (1)/(4) (({dU})/(dz))ˆ2ˆ{\textbackslash}textless(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_)-(1)/(1+2sqrt(6)) (gδ)/(H\_p\_) (∇\_rad\_-∇\_ad\_). We also derive the appropriate diffusion coefficient when the above criterion is not satisfied. Different ranges of turbulent scales may also exist, depending on θ. Interestingly enough, we may notice that the above criterion is also that expressing the transition from shear to semiconvective instabilities.},

It is possible that they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase. Magnetic coupling of disk and star leads to rotational braking at the surface of the star. Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and will not be able to reduce the rotation rate of the core of the star. We investigate the question of whether the magneto-rotational instability can provide turbulent angular momentum transport. We discuss whether differential rotation is present in {CP} stars. Numerical {MHD} simulations of thick stellar shells are performed. An initial differential rotation law is subject to the influence of a magnetic field. This configuration does indeed give rise to a magneto-rotational instability. The emerging flows and magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards. Weak dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde10{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater-2{\textbackslash}textlesssup/{\textbackslash}textgreater in stars) is found from the simulations. First tests with stratified shells show different flows, but the same efficiency of angular-momentum transport.

The method of Kippenhahn \&amp; Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

Such measurements of thousands of mean core rotation would open the way to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms that are able to transport angular momentum from the core to the envelope in red giants. In this work, we detail the principle of the method we developed to obtain automatic measurements of the red giant mean core rotation. This method is based on the stretching of the oscillation spectra and on the use of the so-called Hough transform. We finally validate this method for stars on the red giant branch, where overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings produce complicated frequency spectra.},

This allowed us to determine the effect of magnetic braking on a wide range of spectral types for expected ages of ∼600 Myr for the Hyades and Praesepe. Both clusters show a tight and nearly linear relation between J-Ks colour and rotation period in the F, G and K spectral range. This confirms that loss of angular momentum was significant enough that stars with strongly different initial rotation rates have converged to the same rotation period for a given mass, by the ages of Hyades and Praesepe. In the case of the Hyades, our colour-period sequence extends well into the M dwarf regime and shows a steep increase in the scatter of the colour-period relation, with identification of numerous rapid rotators from ∼0.5 M⊙ down to the lowest masses probed by our survey (∼0.25 M⊙). This provides crucial constraints on the rotational braking time-scales and further clears the way to use gyrochronology as an accurate age measurement tool for main-sequence stars.},

We report rotation periods for 441 stars within this field and determine their cluster membership and binarity based on a decade-long radial velocity survey, proper-motion measurements, and multiband photometric observations. We find that 310 of the stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. The distribution of rotation periods for cluster members span more than 2 orders of magnitude from ∼0.1 to 15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the timespan of the survey. With an age between the zero-age main sequence and the Hyades, and with ∼6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80\% of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color–period plane, and define clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The M35 color–period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition between the two rotational states, of ∼60 Myr and ∼140 Myr for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades, confirm the Skumanich spin-down dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the rotational sequences in the M35 color–period diagram support the use of rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use such gyrochronology to determine “gyro-ages” for M35 from 134 Myr to 161 Myr. We use the M35 data to evaluate new color dependences for the rotational isochrones.},

Interpreting the modulation of stellar light that is caused by star-spots on the time scale of the rotational period depends on knowing the fundamental stellar parameters. Constraints on the angular momentum distribution can be extracted from the true stellar rotational period. By using models with an internal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of rotation periods of subgiant stars we investigate the agreement between theoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can also reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational period measurements from subgiant light curves. We can prove that an evolution assuming solid body rotation is incompatible with the direct measurement of the rotational periods of subgiant stars. Measuring the rotation periods relies on two different periodogram procedures, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and the Plavchan periodogram. Angular momentum evolution models were computed to give us the expected rotation periods for subgiants, which we compared with measured rotational periods. We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal that is compatible in terms of both phase and amplitude with rotational modulation. Rotation periods were directly measured from light curves for 30 subgiant stars and indicate a range of 30 to 100 d for their rotational periods. Our models reproduce the rotational periods obtained from {CoRoT} light curves. These new measurements of rotation periods and stellar models probe the non-rigid rotation of subgiant stars.},

By incorporating Spitzer {IRAC} mid-{IR} measurements, we found that 3-4 objects showing mid-{IR} excesses indicative of the presence of circumstellar discs were all slow rotators, as would be expected in the disc regulation paradigm for early pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, but this result is not statistically significant at present, given the extremely limited sample size.},

We present the results of an extensive search for rotational periods among {NGC} 2264 cluster members, based on photometric monitoring using the {CoRoT} satellite, with a particular attention to the distribution of classical and weak-line T-Tauri stars. {NGC} 2264 is one of the nearest and best studied star forming region in the solar neighbourhood, with an estimated age of 3 Myr, and is the object of a recent simultaneous multiband campaign including a new {CoRoT} observation with the aim to assess the physical origin of the observed variability. We find that the rotational distributions of classical and weak-line T-Tauri star are different, suggesting a difference in the rotational properties of accreting and non-accreting stars.},

This first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in {NGC} 6530, the young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly uniform for 0.5 days {\textbackslash}textless P {\textbackslash}textless 10 days; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level (log {LX} /L bol ≈ -3.3). However, we find a significant positive correlation between {LX} /L bol and corotation radius, suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in {NGC} 6530 is broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster ({ONC}), but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the {ONC} and other young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we argue that {NGC} 6530 may be slightly younger than the {ONC}, making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young, low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {A wide field imager attached to the {MPG}/{ESO} 2.2 m telescope on La Silla has been used to monitor the Orion Nebula Cluster on 45 nights between 25 Dec. 1998 and 28 Feb. 1999. Ninety-two images were obtained during this period through an intermediate band filter centered at 815.9 nm. More than 1500 sources with I magnitudes between 12.5 and 20 were monitored. We find that essentially every star brighter than 16th mag (where the precision is {\textbackslash}textless0.01 mag) is a variable, with about half having a peak-to-peak variation of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.2 mag or more. A clear correlation is found between the level of variability and infrared excess emission, in the sense that stars with evidence for circumstellar disks have larger amplitudes of variation. A search for periodic variables was carried out and 369 such stars were discovered, most or all of which are rotating, spotted T Tauri stars. Periodic variables are most commonly found among the low amplitude variables. 46\% of the stars with magnitudes between 12.5 and 16 and standard deviation, {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterσ{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless 0.1 mag, were found to be periodic, whereas only 24\% of the stars in the same magnitude range with yielded periods. Our work confirms the existence of a bimodal period distribution, with peaks near 2 and 8 days, for stars with and a unimodal distribution peaked near 2 days, for lower mass stars. We show that a statistically significant correlation exists between infrared excess emission and rotation in the sense that slower rotators are more likely to show evidence of circumstellar disks. Slowly rotating stars, with angular velocities, {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterω{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless 1 radian/d, corresponding to rotation periods longer than 6.28 d, have a mean infrared excess emission, , indicative of the presence of inner disks, while rapid rotators, with radians/d, corresponding to rotation periods shorter than 3.14 d, have a much smaller mean of . This supports the hypothesis that disks are involved in regulating stellar rotation during the pre-main sequence phase. We explore a simple and commonly adopted model of rotational evolution in which stars conserve angular velocity while locked to a disk and conserve angular momentum once released. If these assumptions are valid, and if the locking period is 8 days, we find that more than half of the stars in the {ONC} are no longer locked to disks and that an exponential decay model with a disk-locking half-life of about 0.5–1 My fits the observations well. Assuming that the mean ages of the higher and lower mass stars are the same, the faster rotation of the lower mass stars can be understood as either a consequence of a shorter disk-locking time or a shorter initial disk-locking period, or both.},

This is the largest sample of rotation periods for a cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate a number of relations between rotation period, color and the amplitude of photometric variability. Stars with M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.8 Msun show a tight correlation between period and mass with heavier stars rotating more rapidly. There is a group of 4 stars with P {\textbackslash}textgreater 15 days that fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution. Below 0.8 Msun the stars continue to follow the period-mass correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to shorter periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with observations of other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower-main sequence stellar angular momentum evolution. We find that the model reproduces the observations for solar mass stars, but discrepancies are apparent for stars with 0.6 {\textbackslash}textasciitilde{\textbackslash}textless M {\textbackslash}textasciitilde{\textbackslash}textless 1.0 Msun. We also find that for late-K through early-M dwarf stars in this cluster rapid rotators tend to be bluer than slow rotators in B-V but redder than slow rotators in V-I\_\{C\}.

While the gap was tentatively detected in Reinhold \& Hekker (2020), this work represents the first robust detection of the gap in K2 data. This is significant because K2 observed along many lines of sight at wide angular separation, in contrast to Kepler's single line of sight. We interpret this gap as evidence for a departure from the {\textbackslash}tˆ\{-1/2\}{\textbackslash} Skumanich spin down law rather than an indication of a bimodal star formation history.

Using models of angular momentum evolution, we show that angular momentum losses over the {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1-5 Myr age range appear to be needed in order to reproduce the evolution of the slowest rotators in the sample from the {ONC} to {NGC} 2362, as found by many previous studies. By incorporating Spitzer {IRAC} mid-{IR} measurements, we found that 3-4 objects showing mid-{IR} excesses indicative of the presence of circumstellar discs were all slow rotators, as would be expected in the disc regulation paradigm for early pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, but this result is not statistically significant at present, given the extremely limited sample size.},

	abstract = {We analyzed three years of data from the Kepler space mission to derive rotation periods of main-sequence stars below 6500 K. Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period–temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by {McQuillan} et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M☉. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between ∼950 ppm (5th percentile) and ∼22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ∼5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ∼5400 K.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01772},
	abstract = {Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars increases over time and adopt an age–velocity–dispersion relation ({AVR}) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an {AVR}. Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an {RMS} of 1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine learning algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the {McQuillian} et al. (2014) catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25\%. Using predicted rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed age–element abundance trends with literature values.},

	abstract = {Rotational mixing is a prime candidate for explaining the gradual depletion of lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence. However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and stellar data in the sense that they overestimate the internal differential rotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly differentially rotating at young ages but approach a solid body rotation during their lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an additional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for explaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for mixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a ∼20 Myr timescale is required to explain the evolution of the mean rotation pattern along the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate description of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling produces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little mixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr, in agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances we argue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence decreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss the implications of this finding for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic fields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility of intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters using M67 as an example.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using the Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale ({AIMS}) stellar parameter inference code, we infer the masses and ages of a set of representative artificial stars for which models were computed with the Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire ({CESTAM}; the T stands for Transport) evolution code, taking into account rotationally induced mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative acceleration. The observed constraints are asteroseismic and classical properties. The grid of stellar models used for the optimization search include neither atomic diffusion nor rotationally induced mixing. The differences between real and retrieved parameters then provide an estimate of the errors made when neglecting transport processes in stellar parameter inference. Results. We show that for masses lower than 1.3 M , rotation dominates the transport of chemical elements and strongly reduces the effect of atomic diffusion, with net surface abundance modifications similar to solar values. At higher mass, atomic diffusion and rotation are competing equally. Above 1.44 M , atomic diffusion dominates in stellar models with initial rotation lower than 80 km s−1 producing a chemical peculiarity which is not observed in Kepler Legacy stars. This indicates that a transport process of chemical elements is missing, probably linked to the missing transport process of angular momentum needed to explain rotation profiles in solar-like stars. Importantly, neglecting rotation and atomic diffusion (including radiative acceleration) in the models, when inferring the parameters of F-type stars, may lead to respective errors of ≈5\%, ≈2.5\%, and ≈25\% for stellar masses, radii, and ages. Conclusions. Atomic diffusion (including radiative acceleration) and rotational mixing should be taken into account in stellar models in order to determine accurate stellar parameters. When atomic diffusion and shellular rotation are both included, they enable stellar evolution codes to reproduce the observed metal and helium surface abundances for stars with masses up to 1.4 M at solar metallicity. However, if rotation is actually uniform for these stars (as observations seem to indicate), then an additional chemical mixing process is needed together with a revised formulation of rotational mixing. For higher masses, an additional mixing process is needed in any case.},

	abstract = {We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including {PMS} to {ZAMS} spin up, prompt {ZAMS} spin down, and the early-{MS} convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.},

Constraints on the core rotation rate are available starting from the base of the red giant branch ({RGB}) and we are still lacking information on the internal rotation of less evolved subgiants. We identified two young Kepler subgiants, {KIC}8524425 and {KIC}5955122, whose mixed modes are clearly split by rotation. Using the full Kepler data set, we extracted the mode frequencies and rotational splittings for the two stars using a Bayesian approach. We then performed a detailed seismic modeling of both targets and used the rotational kernels to invert their internal rotation profiles. We found that both stars are rotating nearly as solid bodies, with core-envelope contrasts of \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm g\}/{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm p\}=0.68{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.47{\textbackslash} for {KIC}8524425 and {\textbackslash}0.72{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.37{\textbackslash} for {KIC}5955122.

These values are lower than or comparable to the efficiency of the core-envelope coupling during the main sequence, as given by the surface rotation of stars in open clusters. On the other hand, they are higher than the viscosity needed to reproduce the rotation of subgiants near the base of the {RGB}.

	abstract = {Aims: We develop a method for estimating the properties of stellar winds for low-mass main-sequence stars between masses of 0.4 and 1.1 solar masses at a range of distances from the star. Methods: We use 1D thermal pressure driven hydrodynamic wind models run using the Versatile Advection Code. Using in situ measurements of the solar wind, we produce models for the slow and fast components of the solar wind. We consider two radically different methods for scaling the base temperature of the wind to other stars: in Model A, we assume that wind temperatures are fundamentally linked to coronal temperatures, and in Model B, we assume that the sound speed at the base of the wind is a fixed fraction of the escape velocity. In Paper {II} of this series, we use observationally constrained rotational evolution models to derive wind mass loss rates. Results: Our model for the solar wind provides an excellent description of the real solar wind far from the solar surface, but is unrealistic within the solar corona. We run a grid of 1200 wind models to derive relations for the wind properties as a function of stellar mass, radius, and wind temperature. Using these results, we explore how wind properties depend on stellar mass and rotation. Conclusions: Based on our two assumptions about the scaling of the wind temperature, we argue that there is still significant uncertainty in how these properties should be determined. Resolution of this uncertainty will probably require both the application of solar wind physics to other stars and detailed observational constraints on the properties of stellar winds. In the final section of this paper, we give step by step instructions for how to apply our results to calculate the stellar wind conditions far from the stellar surface.},

The seismic modeling of young subgiants can be used to obtain indirect constraints on the core structure during main sequence, thanks to the high probing potential of mixed modes. Aims. We selected the young subgiant {KIC}10273246, observed by Kepler , based on its mixed-mode properties. We thoroughly modeled this star, with the aim of placing constraints on the size of its main-sequence convective core. A corollary goal of this study is to elaborate a modeling technique that is suitable for subgiants and can later be applied to a larger number of targets. Methods. We first extracted the parameters of the oscillation modes of the star using the full Kepler data set. To overcome the challenges posed by the seismic modeling of subgiants, we propose a method that is specifically tailored to subgiants with mixed modes and uses nested optimization. We then applied this method to perform a detailed seismic modeling of {KIC}10273246. Results. We obtain models that show good statistical agreements with the observations, both seismic and non-seismic. We show that including core overshooting in the models significantly improves the quality of the seismic fit, optimal models being found for α ov = 0.15. Higher amounts of core overshooting strongly worsen the agreement with the observations and are thus firmly ruled out. We also find that having access to two g -dominated mixed modes in young subgiants allows us to place stronger constraints on the gradient of molecular weight in the core and on the central density. Conclusions. This study confirms the high potential of young subgiants with mixed modes to investigate the size of main-sequence convective cores. It paves the way for a more general study including the subgiants observed with Kepler , {TESS}, and eventually {PLATO}.},

The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. The decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B supergiants can be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation is a strong function of both mass and evolutionary state. Missions such as Kepler and {CoRoT} provide tens of thousands of rotation periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations (∼0.4–2.0 M☉). We find that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence ({MS}) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the {MS} with high rotation rates. Intermediate rotators (10–40 days) can be either cool {MS} dwarfs, suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses. Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There exists a period–age relation for subgiants distinct from the {MS} period–age relations. There is also a period–radius relation that can be used as a constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on the {MS} persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.},

Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence. Results. We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as M˙ ∝ R2 Ω1.33 M−3.36. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age. Conclusions. There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

	abstract = {In this article we first review the main physical effects to be considered in the building of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence ({MS}). The internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion processes, and mass loss. In turn, differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper {MS}, for red giants, supergiants, and W-R stars. A fast rotation enhances the mass loss by stellar winds and, conversely, high mass loss removes a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the breakup or Ω-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be and {LBV} stars. The effects of rotation on the tracks in the {HR} diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue-to-red supergiant ratios, the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars, and the chemical abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and {AGB} stars are reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are examined, along with the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity Ω as well.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201629187},
	abstract = {Context. Rotation is one of the key physical mechanisms that deeply impact the evolution of stars. Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of angular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Aims. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating, stably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modelled and its strength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent transport is anisotropic. So far only phenomenological prescriptions have been proposed for the transport in the horizontal direction. This, however, constitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar hydrodynamics in evolution codes. We aim to improve its modelling. Methods. We derived a new theoretical prescription for the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral formalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification, rotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent transport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of the radial differential rotation is derived. We implemented this framework in the stellar evolution code {STAREVOL} and quantified its impact on the rotational and structural evolution of solar metallicity low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red giant branch. Results. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as N ⁴ τ ² /(2Ω ² ), N and Ω being the buoyancy and rotation frequencies respectively and τ a time characterizing the source of turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar strength in average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions even if it can be locally larger below the convective envelope. Hence the models computed with the new formalism still build up too steep internal rotation gradients compared to helioseismic and asteroseismic constraints. As a consequence, a complementary transport mechanism such as internal gravity waves or magnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of angular momentum along stellar evolution. Conclusions. The new prescription links for the first time the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones to their stratification and rotation. This constitutes important theoretical progress and demonstrates how turbulent closure models should be improved to get firm conclusions on the potential importance of other processes that transport angular momentum and chemicals inside stars along their evolution.},

Here, we want to examine the role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe the behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport. We use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows variable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of rotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of spherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves. It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves in non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition of angular momentum by such waves is important.},

The average space velocity of a normal star in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.},

In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ∼27\% in radius, ∼17\% in mass, and ∼51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved \{log\}g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants.

	abstract = {I describe a method to transform a set of stellar evolution tracks onto a uniform basis and then interpolate within that basis to construct stellar isochrones. This method accommodates a broad range of stellar types, from substellar objects to high-mass stars, and phases of evolution, from the pre-main sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence. I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones. The programs that implement these methods are free and open-source; they may be obtained from the project webpage.1},

In this work, we present models with solar-scaled abundance ratios covering a wide range of ages (5≤slant \{log\}(\{Age\}) [\{year\}]≤slant 10.3), masses (0.1≤slant M/\{M\}⊙ ≤slant 300), and metallicities (-2.0≤slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]≤slant 0.5). The models are self-consistently and continuously evolved from the pre-main sequence ({PMS}) to the end of hydrogen burning, the white dwarf cooling sequence, or the end of carbon burning, depending on the initial mass. We also provide a grid of models evolved from the {PMS} to the end of core helium burning for -4.0≤slant [\{\{Z\}\}/\{\{H\}\}] -2.0.

	abstract = {Recent observations show He- and N-enhancements in fast rotating O-type stars, while studies on shear mixing in rotating stars have shown that the μ-gradients generally inhibit mixing processes. However, these studies (including ours) ignored the other sources of turbulence, such as semiconvection and horizontal turbulence, which may be present in the medium and may modify the onset of shear mixing. Indeed, in massive stars most of the zone where μ-gradients would inhibit mixing according to the Richardson criterion is semiconvective, i.e. such a zone would experience some turbulence anyway. This leads us to introduce the following working hypothesis: in a semiconvection region (or in any zone with other sources of turbulence) some fraction of the local energy excess in the shear is degraded by turbulence to change the local entropy gradient. Consistently with this hypothesis we derive the effects of the shear on the entropy gradient, then on the T- and μ-gradients, and express the fraction of the μ-gradient which can be diffused. From the basic equations describing the evolution of temperature perturbations we obtain the velocities of fluid elements under some specific conditions, and then we get the associated diffusion coefficient D. Interestingly enough, the values of D tend towards the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection, when the shears become negligible, and towards the coefficient by Zahn (1992A\&amp;A...265..115Z; cf. also Maeder and Meynet 1996A\&amp;A...313..140M) when shears dominate. We also examine the coupling of shear mixing and thermal transport; a third order equation expressing the combined effects is obtained. The solutions for shears in semiconvective and radiative zones are examined in detail. The main result of the above developments is the slight progressive erosion of the μ-barriers in stars, for cases where the usual form of the Richardson criterion would have imposed an insuperable threshold. In Appendices A and B we rediscuss the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection and find a more general expression, not limited to the adiabatic case.},

Though the fits are thus somewhat less certain because of our uncertainty of how to manage the surface effect, these results also demonstrate that it is feasible to model the individual mode frequencies of subgiants and low-luminosity red giants, and hence also use these individual stars to help to constrain stellar models.},

	abstract = {Space-based observations of solar-like oscillations present an opportunity to constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic difference that must be corrected. We introduce and evaluate two parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough (1990). The first we call a cubic term proportional to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnuˆ3/{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash} and the second has an additional inverse term proportional to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnuˆ\{-1\}/{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash}, where \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnu{\textbackslash} and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash} are the frequency and inertia of an oscillation mode. We first show that these formulae accurately correct model frequencies of two different solar models ... We then incorporate the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations of the well-studied {CoRoT} target {HD}52265. For comparison, we also run the pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (2008). The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for {HD}52265 are consistent with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is significantly worse but yields consistent parameters ... We find that the cubic term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to implement in an existing pipeline. ... This parametrization is thus a useful new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode frequencies can be exploited.},

	abstract = {The evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main sequence ({ZAMS}) masses in the range 8 to 25 M\_sun is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the {ZAMS} ranges from zero to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 70 \% of break-up. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of rotationally induced circulation and instablities. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of 1E16...1E17 erg s. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to break-up. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.},

	abstract = {The Kepler space mission has made it possible to measure the rotational splittings of mixed modes in red giants, thereby providing an unprecedented opportunity to probe the internal rotation of these stars. Asymmetries have been detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is unexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far are found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces symmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a way of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet asymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical {\textbackslash}l=2{\textbackslash} multiplets of the Kepler young red giant {KIC}7341231 and obtain precise estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected multiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for {\textbackslash}l=2{\textbackslash} mixed modes all along the red giant branch ({RGB}). For {\textbackslash}l=1{\textbackslash} modes, these effects can be neglected only at the base of the {RGB}. They must therefore be taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here, they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.},

	abstract = {The preparation of science objectives of the {ESA}'s {PLATO} space mission will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves. We developed a light-curve simulator named the {PLATO} Solar-like Light-curve Simulator ({PSLS}) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical {PLATO} targets, i.e. showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, {PSLS} also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the {PLATO} multi-telescope concept. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for {PLATO}. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases. These corrected light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in {PSLS}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below 20muHz and are found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by Kepler on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations. {PSLS} reproduces the main properties of expected {PLATO} light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the {PLATO} cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the {PLATO} mission.},

The spin evolution is calculated using model stars of initial mass 1, 1.5, and 5 \{M\}⊙ , taking into account mass loss on the giant branches. We also include the deposition of orbital angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion, as influenced by tidal drag along with the excitation of orbital eccentricity by a fluctuating gravitational quadrupole moment. A range of angular velocity profiles \{\{Ω \}\}(r) is considered in the envelope, extending from solid rotation to constant specific angular momentum. We focus on the backreaction of the Coriolis force, and the threshold for dynamo action in the inner envelope. Quantitative agreement with measurements of core rotation in subgiants and post-He core flash stars by Kepler is obtained with a two-layer angular velocity profile: uniform specific angular momentum where the Coriolis parameter \{Co\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashequiv \{\{Ω \}\}\{τ \}\{con\}≲ 1 (here \{τ \}\{con\} is the convective time), and \{\{Ω \}\}(r){\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto \{r\}-1 where \{Co\}≳ 1. The inner profile is interpreted in terms of a balance between the Coriolis force and angular pressure gradients driven by radially extended convective plumes. Inward angular momentum pumping reduces the surface rotation of subgiants, and the need for a rejuvenated magnetic wind torque. The co-evolution of internal magnetic fields and rotation is considered in Kissin \& Thompson, along with the breaking of the rotational coupling between core and envelope due to heavy mass loss.},

Until now, laws of the form T\_eff {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto g\_effˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\} have been used, but they are only valid for slowly rotating stars. We propose a simple model that can describe the latitudinal variations in the flux of rotating stars at any rotation rate. This model assumes that the energy flux is a divergence-free vector that is antiparallel to the effective gravity. When mass distribution can be described by a Roche model, the latitudinal variations in the effective temperature only depend on a single parameter, namely the ratio of the equatorial velocity to the Keplerian velocity. We validate this model by comparing its predictions to those of the most realistic two-dimensional models of rotating stars issued from the {ESTER} code. The agreement is very good, as it is with the observations of two rapidly rotating stars, \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\} Aql and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\} Leo. We suggest that as long as a gray atmosphere can be accepted, the inversion of data on flux distribution coming from interferometric observations of rotating stars uses such a model, which has just one free parameter.},

We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars (“shellular rotation law”, cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime).

We present an investigation based on the Infrared Flux Method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]{\textbackslash}textless-2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities.},

	abstract = {Methods. A semi-analytical excitation model was used to estimate the angular momentum wave flux. The characteristic timescale associated with the angular momentum transport by {IGW} was computed and compared to the contraction timescale throughout the radiative region of stellar models at different evolutionary stages. Results. We show that {IGW} can efficiently counteract the contraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of the radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of the radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on the evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates inferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such an agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation mechanism driven by {IGW}. This result is obtained under the assumption of a smooth rotation profile in the radiative region and holds true even if a wide range of values is considered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red giant branch, we find that {IGW} remain insufficient, on their own, to explain the observations because of an excessive radiative damping. Conclusions. {IGW} generated by penetrative convection are able to efficiently extract angular momentum from the core of stars on the subgiant branch and accordingly have to be taken into account. Moreover, agreements with the observations reinforce the idea that their effect is essential to regulate the amplitude of the radial-differential rotation in subgiant stars. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism must likely be invoked.},

	abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function ({ACF}) of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {While magnetic fields have long been considered to be important for the evolution of magnetic non-degenerate stars and compact stars, it has become clear in recent years that actually all of the stars are deeply affected. This is particularly true regarding their internal angular momentum distribution, but magnetic fields may also influence internal mixing processes and even the fate of the star. We propose a new framework for stellar evolution simulations, in which the interplay between magnetic field, rotation, mass loss, and changes in the stellar density and temperature distributions are treated self-consistently. For average large-scale stellar magnetic fields which are symmetric to the axis of rotation of the star, we derive 1D evolution equations for the toroidal and poloidal components from the mean-field {MHD} equation by applying Alfven's theorem, and a conservative form of the angular momentum transfer due to the Lorentz force is formulated. We implement our formalism into a numerical stellar evolution code and simulate the magneto-rotational evolution of 1.5 M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash} stars. The Lorentz force aided by the \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash} effect imposes torsional Alfven waves propagating through the magnetized medium, leading to near-rigid rotation within the Alfven timescale. Our models with different initial spins and B-fields can reproduce the main observed properties of Ap/Bp stars. Calculations continued to the red-giant regime show a pronounced core-envelope coupling, which reproduces the core and surface rotation periods determined by asteroseismic observations.},

For the very steep rotation law {\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto Rˆ\{-2\} (the Rayleigh limit) and for small Pm the threshold values of rotation and field for this Azimuthal {MagnetoRotational} Instability ({AMRI}) scale with the ordinary Reynolds number and the Hartmann number, resp.

For fluids with more flat rotation laws the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number are no longer typical quantities for the instability. For the weakly nonlinear system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy are derived for magnetic Prandtl numbers {\textbackslash}textbackslashleq 1. We find that the magnetic energy grows monotonically with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, while the kinetic energy grows with Rm/{\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt\{Pm\}. The resulting turbulent Schmidt number, as the ratio of the `eddy' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar (such as lithium) is of order 20 for Pm=1, but for small Pm it drops to order unity. Hence, in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the transport of angular momentum by {AMRI} is always accompanied by an intense mixing of the plasma, until the rotation becomes rigid.},

The inferred rotation rates are 10–30 days for the ≈0.2 M He degenerate cores on the {RGB} and 30–100 days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf ({WD}) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler–Spruit dynamo). We find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the {RGB} and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early {RGB} of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling {WD} phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic pulsation code, {ADIPLS}, to explicitly highlight this shortfall when applied to a specific Kepler asteroseismic target, {KIC}8366239.},

We demonstrate that magnetized Taylor–Couette flows with such profiles become unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations if at least one of the diffusivities is finite. We also find that for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the lines of marginal instability scale with the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. In the limit the lines of marginal instability completely lie below the line for and for they completely lie above this line. For any finite value of , however, the lines of marginal instability cross the line , which separates slow from fast rotation. The minimum values of the field strength and the rotation rate that are needed for the instability (slightly) grow if the rotation law becomes flat. In this case, the electric current of the background field becomes so strong that the current-driven Tayler instability (which also exists without rotation) appears in the bifurcation map at low Hartmann numbers.},

	abstract = {The detection of mixed modes in subgiants and red giants by the {CoRoT} and {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{Kepler\} space-borne missions allows us to investigate the internal structure of evolved low-mass stars. In particular, the measurement of the mean core rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraints on the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistribution in stars. It showed that the current stellar evolution codes including the modelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. An additional physical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core is thus necessary. Our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. To this end, we developed a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both the mean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. In this article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismic observations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer is obtained. This is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 {\textbackslash}M\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot\}{\textbackslash} at three evolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed by {CoRoT} and Kepler. We show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regions of subgiants and red giants. However, this transport of angular momentum from the core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction in subgiants and early red giants. In contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixed modes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the core contraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. Our results thus indicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observed spin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is to be invoked for subgiants and early red giants.},

We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80\%) can be identified from Gaia {DR}3 and {APOGEE} criteria – important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real starspot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.008 and 0.003\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.002 for main sequence {GK} stars and evolved red giants respectively, confirming that the technique does not produce spurious spot signals in inactive stars. Starspots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn timescales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut \& Mamajek empirical scale. Starspot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn timescale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full {APOGEE} catalog, with broad applications to stellar, galactic, and exoplanetary astrophysics.},

Mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions of intermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). Our aim was to exploit\& the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amount of radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars using Kepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars. We selected a subsample of Kepler secondary clump stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By applying a thorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of both gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes (trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then used these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al. 2013). We obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating {\textbackslash}1.8{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.3{\textbackslash} to {\textbackslash}3.2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm1.0{\textbackslash} times faster than the envelope. The last target was found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. This demonstrates that an efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the short-lived subgiant phase, or once He-burning has started in the core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.},

The space-based photometry reveals pulsation properties previously inaccessible to ground-based observations. We observe a sharp dichotomy in oscillation mode line widths at roughly 800 s, such that white dwarf pulsations with periods exceeding 800 s have substantially broader mode line widths, more reminiscent of a damped harmonic oscillator than a heat-driven pulsator. Extended Kepler coverage also permits extensive mode identification: we identify the spherical degree of 87 out of 201 unique radial orders, providing direct constraints of the rotation period for 20 of these 27 {DAVs}, more than doubling the number of white dwarfs with rotation periods determined via asteroseismology. We also obtain spectroscopy from 4 m-class telescopes for all {DAVs} with Kepler photometry. Using these homogeneously analyzed spectra, we estimate the overall mass of all 27 {DAVs}, which allows us to measure white dwarf rotation as a function of mass, constraining the endpoints of angular momentum in low- and intermediate-mass stars.

We find that transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismic observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical description of stars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles. For instance, we find that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability does not extract enough angular momentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase of the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to significantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. Conclusions. Our results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontal turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanism not included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow down the rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.},

	abstract = {The formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the great outstanding problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step towards achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.},

We investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the physical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods. We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant {KIC} 8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of {KIC} 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results. We find that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant {KIC} 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity νadd corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be νadd = 3 × 104 cm2 s−1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.},

Unfortunately, in many respects calculations of the evolution of the chemical abundance profiles in stars are still affected by sometimes sizable uncertainties.

We computed stellar evolution models with rotation and model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant diffusive process parameterised by an additional viscosity in the equation of angular momentum transport. We constrained the values of this viscosity to match the mean core rotation rates of red giants and their behaviour with mass and evolution using asteroseismic indicators along the red giant branch and in the red clump. Results. For red giants in the hydrogen-shell burning phase, the transport of angular momentum must be more efficient in more massive stars. The additional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude in the mass range M ∼ 1–2.5 M . As stars evolve along the red giant branch, the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum must increase for low-mass stars (M 2 M ) and remain approximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M M 2.5 M ). In red clump stars, the additional viscosities must be an order of magnitude higher than in younger red giants of similar mass during the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Conclusions. In combination with previous efforts, we obtain a clear picture of how the physical processes acting in stellar interiors should redistribute angular momentum from the end of the main sequence until the core-helium burning phase for low- and intermediate-mass stars to satisfy the asteroseismic constraints.},

	abstract = {This review assesses the current state of knowledge of how the elements were produced in the Big Bang, in stellar lives and deaths, and by interactions in interstellar gas. We begin with statements of fact and discuss the evidence that convinced astronomers that the Sun is fusing hydrogen, that low-mass stars produce heavy elements through neutron capture, that massive stars can explode as supernovae and that supernovae of all types produce new elements. Nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang, through cosmic ray spallation, and in exploding white dwarfs is only ranked below the above facts in certainty because the evidence, while overwhelming, is so far circumstantial. Next, we highlight the flaws in our current understanding of the predictions for lithium production in the Big Bang and/or its destruction in stars and for the production of the elements with atomic number Z∼45 Z∼45 . While the theory that neutron star mergers produce elements through neutron-capture has powerful circumstantial evidence, we are unconvinced that they produce all of the elements past nickel. Also in dispute is the exact mechanism or mechanisms that cause the white dwarfs to explode. It is difficult to determine the origin of rare isotopes because signatures of their production are weak. We are uncertain about the production sites of some lithium and nitrogen isotopes and proton-rich heavy nuclei. Finally, Betelgeuse is probably not the next star to become a supernovae in the Milky Way, in part because Betelgeuse may collapse directly to a black hole instead. The accumulated evidence in this review shows that we understand the major production sites for the elements, but islands of uncertainty in the periodic table exist. Resolving these uncertainties requires in particular understanding explosive events with compact objects and understanding the nature of the first stars and is therefore primed for new discoveries in the next decades.

This instability may be a key player in transporting angular momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains mostly unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability, whereas here we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq model in a modified shearing box for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations with stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear instability and derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear evolution. The instability is found to behave very differently compared with its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the development of strong zonal jets ("layering" in the angular momentum), which can considerably enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations. The jets are, in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle that corresponds initially with that of the linear modes, but which evolves with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability transports angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it does at the equator, and we estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute to the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters.},

This instability may provide an important contribution to angular momentum transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq Cartesian shearing box model, which represents a small patch of a differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations are also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial direction. The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric instability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability. This is no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability behaves nonlinearly in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations – and those in 3D with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction – quickly develop strong jets along the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to predator-prey-like temporal dynamics. In 3D, the instability initially produces homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport, though in some cases jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a simple theory for nonlinear saturation of the {GSF} instability and its resulting angular momentum transport. This theory is straightforward to implement in stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation. We estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute towards explaining the missing angular momentum transport required in red giant stars, and play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline.},

The eight stars consist of four pairs, with each pair occupying a distinct phase of stellar evolution: two G dwarfs, two turnoff stars, two G subgiants, and two red clump ({RC}) K giants. The abundance analysis uses near-{IR} high-resolution spectra (λ1.5–1.7 μm) from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey and derives abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for 2M08510076+1153115 suggest that this star is a solar twin, exhibiting abundance differences relative to the Sun of ≤0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical homogeneity is found within each class of stars (∼0.02 dex), while significant abundance variations (∼0.05–0.20 dex) are found across the different evolutionary phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest abundances, while the {RCs} tend to have the largest. Non-{LTE} corrections to the {LTE}-derived abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. A detailed comparison of the derived Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca abundances with recently published surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical diffusion provides a good match between the observed and predicted abundances as a function of stellar mass.

	abstract = {Chemical abundances for 15 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) are presented for 83 stellar members of the 4 Gyr old solar-metallicity open cluster M67. The sample contains stars spanning a wide range of evolutionary phases, from G dwarfs to red clump stars. The abundances were derived from near-{IR} (λ1.5–1.7 μm) high-resolution spectra (R = 22,500) from the {SDSS}-{IV}/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment ({APOGEE}) survey. A 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis was carried out using the {APOGEE} synthetic spectral libraries, via χ2 minimization of the synthetic and observed spectra with the {qASPCAP} code. We found significant abundance differences (∼0.05–0.30 dex) between the M67 member stars as a function of the stellar mass (or position on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram), where the abundance patterns exhibit a general depletion (in [X/H]) in stars at the main-sequence turnoff. The amount of the depletion is different for different elements. We find that atomic diffusion models provide, in general, good agreement with the abundance trends for most chemical species, supporting recent studies indicating that measurable atomic diffusion operates in M67 stars.},

We note that there is a significant abundance difference ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.1–0.2 dex) between subgiants and turn-off stars, which can be interpreted as the signature of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models with diffusion agree with the observed abundance results. Some turn-off stars do not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases diffusion can be inhibited, or they might have undergone some sort of mixing event related to planets.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterConclusions}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater Our results pose additional challenges for chemical tagging when using turn-off stars.

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of ≈2.4\% in temperature, ≈2.0\% in luminosity, and ≈4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order ≈5\% in mass and ≈20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

The contours can be represented by an equation of the simple exponential type. The presence of the Stark effect is shown by the asymmetry of He 4388 and by the "forbidden" line X 4470 of helium in the violet wing of He 4472. "Dish-shaped" contours of the lines in the spectra of i6 X Aqi., 4 {\textbackslash}textasciitilde Cor., i{\textbackslash}textasciitilde q Tau., On., and 22 X Cep. indicate axial rotation of these stars. By Mime's theory, logarithms of the number of atoms responsible for producing an absorption line are computed for various assumptions of the physical properties of the stars. These are shown in the form of curves by plots of log N{\textbackslash}textasciitilde against the tempera- ture. The number of atoms {NHf} is determined for each star with use of Unsold's theory. To eliminate the Stark effect and the broadening due to rotation, {NHf} is determined by comparing the areas of the observed contours with those given by theory. A value of 0.1 was arbitrarily chosen forf, and the resulting numbers of atoms have been compared with the curves computed from Milne's theory. The observations support the assump- tion that the coefficient of absorption varies with the pressure, rather than that it is a constant. The observations indicate pressures of 783 dynes/cm2 to 9270 dynes/cm2 for g equal to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde cm/sec.,2 the temperatures being from 10,0000 to 30,000{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$.

The results indicate that that there is indeed an age-metallicity relation present in the thick disk. By dividing the stellar sample into sub-groups, separated by 0.1 dex in metallicity, we show that the median age decreases by about 5–7 Gyr when going from [Fe/H] ≈ −0.8 to [Fe/H] ≈ −0.1. Combining our results with our newly published α-element trends for a local sample of thick disk stars that show signatures from supernovae type Ia ({SN} Ia), we draw the conclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the {SN} Ia rate is of the order of 3–4 Gyr in the thick disk. The tentative evidence for a thick disk {AMR} that we present here also has implications for the thick disk formation scenario; star-formation must have been an ongoing process for several billion years. This appears to strengthen the hypothesis that the thick disk originated from a merger event with a companion galaxy that puffed up a pre-existing thin disk.},

There are many physical factors that contribute to the formation of the contour. The most important are: (1) the abundance of the absorbing atoms in the gas, (2) the Stark effect, and (3) Doppler effects due to the rotation of the stars. We are here concerned with the first of these, which is usually designated as `natural widening' of spectral lines. H. N. Russell and others have shown that this type of broadening is particularly important in the stars because of the large number of absorbing atoms present in a stellar reversing layer. It is responsible for the enormous widths of the H and K lines of Ca+ in the later spectral types.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented to compute age estimates from theoretical isochrones using temperature, luminosity and metallicity data for individual stars. Based on Bayesian probability theory, this method avoids the systematic biases affecting simpler strategies and provides reliable estimates of the age probability distribution function for late-type dwarfs. Basic assumptions concerning the a priori parameter distribution suitable for the solar neighbourhood are combined with the likelihood assigned to the observed data to yield the complete posterior age probability. This method is especially relevant for G dwarfs in the 3–15 Gyr range of ages, crucial to the study of the chemical and dynamical history of the Galaxy. In many cases, it yields markedly different results from the traditional approach of reading the derived age from the isochrone nearest to the data point. We show that the strongest process affecting the traditional approach is that of strongly favouring computed ages near the end-of-main-sequence lifetime. The Bayesian method compensates for this potential bias and generally assigns much higher probabilities to lower main-sequence ages, compared with short-lived evolved stages. This has a strong influence on any application to galactic studies, especially given the present uncertainties on the absolute temperature scale of the stellar evolution models. In particular, the known mismatch between the model predictions and the observations for moderately metal-poor dwarfs (−1 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; −0.3) has a dramatic effect on the traditional age determination.We apply our method to the classic sample of Edvardsson et al., who derived the age–metallicity relation ({AMR}) of 189 field dwarfs with precisely determined abundances. We show how much of the observed scatter in the {AMR} is caused by the interplay between the systematic biases affecting the traditional age determination, the colour mismatch with the evolution models and the presence of undetected binaries. Using new parallax, temperature and metallicity data, our age determination for the same sample indicates that the intrinsic dispersion in the {AMR} is at most 0.15 dex and probably lower. In particular, we show that old, metal-rich objects ([Fe/H]∼ 0.0 dex, age \&gt; 5 Gyr) and young, metal-poor objects ([Fe/H] \&lt; −0.5 dex, age \&lt; 6 Gyr) in many observed {AMR} plots are artefacts caused by too simple a treatment of the age determination. The incompatibility of those {AMR} plots with a well-mixed interstellar medium may therefore only be apparent. Incidentally, our results tend to restore confidence in the method of age determination from the chromospheric activity for field dwarfs.},

	abstract = {Broad and shallow absorption lines in stellar spectra are shown to be due to axial rotation. The evidence is based upon the following facts: (a) the broadening depends upon wave-length, as required by the Doppler principle; (b) in spectroscop'ic binaries there is a distinct correlation between line width on one side and period and amplitude on the other; and (c) as was shown by Elvey, the contours of "dish-shaped" lines agree well with the theoretical shapes of lines of rapidly rotating stars. A survey of the spectra of stars of various types shows that rapid rotation is peculiar to the earliest spectral classes. The B- and A-stars display the greatest tendency toward rapid rotation. In the F's the proportion of rapidly rotating stars is smaller, and in classes G, K, and M no cases of rapid rotation have been observed in single stars. The effect of rotation upon the contours of components of spectroscopic binaries is discussed. In a Virginis the stronger component is found to rotate with an equatorial velocity of 200 km/sec., while for the fainter component the rotational velocity is not more than about 50 km/sec. This indicates a marked difference in the size of the com- ponents. The ratio of the radii is roughly 4 to i. The contours of lines in i{\textbackslash}textasciitilde Ursae Majoris suggest an equatorial velocity of about 200 km/sec. This single star is thus similar to the stronger component of a Virginis. Both stars are found to be stable, but the characteristic quantity w2/27r{\textbackslash}textasciitildeyp is not far from the critical value where the Maclaurin ellipsoids of rotation lose stability. It is suggested that there is a transition between close s{\textbackslash}textasciitildeectroscopic binaries and rapidly rotating single -stars in the earliest spectral classes.

We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the {STAREVOL} code, we provide an updated {PMS} grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to {\textbackslash}Z=0.0134{\textbackslash}. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5{\textbackslash}{textbackslashMs} with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity – and its constitutive physics – is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range. These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, {TESS} and {PLATO}.},

Unfortunately, rotation period {\textbackslash}(P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}){\textbackslash} measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto {\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm age\}{\textbackslash}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag{\textbackslash}textbackslash"ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}1.4-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia {DR}2 to identify likely single-star members of the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}1-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}0.8 to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}0.6 {\textbackslash}M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in {NGC} 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, {NGC} 6811's color-{\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to {\textbackslash}T\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm eff\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 4295{\textbackslash} K (K5V, 0.7 {\textbackslash}M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many {MCMC} methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, {HMC}'s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashepsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler ({NUTS}), an extension to {HMC} that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. {NUTS} uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, {NUTS} perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard {HMC} method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashepsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. {NUTS} can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. {NUTS} is also suitable for applications such as {BUGS}-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

This concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed mass during the pre-{MS}. These spots decrease the luminosity and Teff of stars, leading to a displacement on the {HR} diagram. This displacement causes isochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can lead to the spurious appearance of an age spread in a co-eval population.},

	abstract = {The correlation between stellar activity, as measured by the indicator {DRHK}, and the Rossby number Ro in late-type stars is revisited in light of recent developments in solar dynamo theory. Different stellar interior models, based on both mixing-length theory and the full spectrum of turbulence, are used in order to see to what extent the correlation of activity with Rossby number is model dependent, or otherwise can be considered universal. Although we find some modest model dependence, we find that the correlation of activity with Rossby number is significantly better than with rotation period alone for all the models we consider. Dynamo theory suggests that activity should scale with the dynamo number. A current model of the solar dynamo, the so-called interface dynamo, proposes that the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field by differential rotation (the v-effect) and the production of the poloidal magnetic field from toroidal by helical turbulence (the a-effect) take place in different, adjacent layers near the base of the convection zone. A new scale analysis based on the interface dynamo shows that the appropriate dynamo number does not depend on the Rossby number alone, but also depends on an additional dimensionless factor related to the differential rotation. This leads to a new interpretation of the correlation between activity and Rossby number, which in turn leads to some conclusions about the magnitude of differential rotation in the dynamo layers of late-type main-sequence stars.},

	abstract = {We compare the properties of recent samples of the lithium abundances in halo stars to one another and to the predictions of theoretical models including rotational mixing, and we examine the data for trends with metal abundance. We apply two statistical tests to the data: a Kolomorgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test sensitive to the behavior around the sample median, and Monte Carlo tests of the probability to draw the observed number of outliers from the theoretical distributions. We find from a K-S test that in the absence of any correction for chemical evolution, the Ryan, Norris, \& Beers ({RNB}) sample is fully consistent with mild rotational mixing induced depletion and, therefore, with an initial lithium abundance higher than the observed value. Tests for outliers depend sensitively on the threshold for defining their presence, but we find a 10\%-45\% probability that the {RNB} sample is drawn from the rotationally mixed models with a 0.2 dex median depletion with lower probabilities corresponding to higher depletion factors. Including or excluding the one upper limit in the sample changes the absolute probabilities but does not affect the overall conclusions. When chemical evolution trends (Li/H vs. Fe/H) are included in our analysis we find that the dispersion in the {RNB} sample is not explained by chemical evolution; the inferred bounds on lithium depletion from rotational mixing are similar to those derived from models without chemical evolution. Finally, we explore the differences between the {RNB} sample and other halo star data sets. We find that differences in the equivalent width measurements are primarily responsible for different observational conclusions concerning the lithium dispersion in halo stars. The different data sets are all consistent with mild stellar depletion, but the systematic errors arising from different observational data sets are a major component of the error budget and need to be addressed. The implications for cosmology are discussed. We find that the standard big bang nucleosynthesis predicted lithium abundance that corresponds to the deuterium abundance inferred from observations of high-redshift, low-metallicity {QSO} absorbers requires halo star lithium depletion in an amount consistent with that from our models of rotational mixing but inconsistent with no depletion.},

In a group of stars with individual spectral types from G2 to K7, the cycle periods were consistent with the relation P(cyc) is approximately equal to (P rot/tauc) exp n, where tauc is the convective turnover time near the bottom of the convection zone.

	abstract = {Main-sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging in age from 50 to 350 Myr, how broadband {UBV} color–color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This {UBV} color–color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B − V) and estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on parallaxes from Gaia data release 2 find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older ({\textbackslash}textgreater100 Myr) clusters, such as the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method find that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within ∼10\% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30\%–80\% younger. This illustrates the importance of rotation in deriving ages in the youngest ({\textbackslash}textless100 Myr) clusters.},

Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable according to an objective statistical criterion. On a year-to-year timescale, young active stars become fainter when their Ca {II} emission increases, while older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca {II} emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y stellar filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample.},

It is shown that the average rotational velocity is higher among those with Ca ii emission than among those without. Since there is strong evidence that stars with Ca ii emission are younger, on the average, than most solar-type stars, a picture is advanced in which rotation declines with advancing age. It is proposed that magnetically coupled winds, similar to the solar wind, are responsible for this deceleration even after a star takes up residence on the main sequence. The winds are presumably generated only in stars which have subsurface hydrogen convection zones and concomitant chromospheres. Estimates of rotational velocity among solar-type stars in the Hyades and Pleiades are given which confirm this general picture. It is shown that the mean rotation in the Pleiades is highest of all groups considered and averages about 40 km/sec for stars of mass 1.20 o. The time scale for reduction by a factor of 2 of the rotational velocities of Pleiades stars is equal to the age of the Hyades, about 4 X 108 years.},

The observed relationship between mass, age and rotation in open clusters shows the progressive development of a slow-rotator sequence among stars possessing a radiative interior and a convective envelope during their pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution. After 0.6 Gyr, most cluster members of this type have settled on this sequence. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Aims: The observed clustering on this sequence suggests that it corresponds to some equilibrium or asymptotic condition that still lacks a complete theoretical interpretation, and which is crucial to our understanding of the stellar angular momentum evolution. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Methods: We couple a rotational evolution model, which takes internal differential rotation into account, with classical and new proposals for the wind braking law, and fit models to the data using a Monte Carlo Markov chain ({MCMC}) method tailored to the problem at hand.

The observed evolution in the 0.1-2.5 Gyr age range and in the 0.85-1.10 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater⊙{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater mass range is best reproduced by assuming an empirical mass dependence of the wind angular momentum loss proportional to the convective turnover timescale and to the stellar moment of inertia. Period isochrones based on our {MCMC} fit provide a tool for inferring stellar ages of solar-like main-sequence stars from their mass and rotation period that is largely independent of the wind braking model adopted. These effectively represent gyro-chronology relationships that take the physics of the two-zone model for the stellar angular momentum evolution into account.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for the evolution of gas phase metallicity gradients in galaxies from first principles. We show that metallicity gradients depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration time-scale, production, transport, consumption, and loss. Our model finds that most galaxy metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts. When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations. We also predict the evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both matched stellar masses and matched abundances. Our model shows that massive galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence. Lastly, we show that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be in equilibrium. In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.},

The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which can be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to be an accurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of rotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A prominent observational feature of the mass–rotation period diagrams of open clusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and persistence of this slow-rotator sequence across several billion years imply an approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In particular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently toward longer periods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the ≈700 Myr Praesepe and the 1 Gyr {NGC} 6811 clusters, however, are not fully consistent with this general pattern. While the stars of 1 {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterM}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater⊙{\textbackslash}textlesssub/{\textbackslash}textgreater on the slow-rotator sequence of the older {NGC} 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger Praesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (≲0.8 {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterM}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater⊙{\textbackslash}textlesssub/{\textbackslash}textgreater). In other words, it seems that low-mass stars have not been spinning down in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a manifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The resurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate for that lost at the surface due to wind braking. In our model the internal redistribution of angular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling occurs at different ages for stars of different masses. The semi-empirical mass dependence of the rotational coupling timescale included in our model produces an evolution of the slow-rotator sequence in very good agreement with the observations. Our model, in particular, explains the stalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and {NGC} 6811, and predicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other mass ranges.},

The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by {McQuillan} et al., is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is correlated with height above the Galacitc plane, with the ratio of rapidly rotating younger stars dropping strongly for stars above Z {\textbackslash}textgreater 90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of Δ{MG} ∼ 0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient may indicate that main-sequence evolution produces offsets in color–magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.},

We have obtained {VLT}/{FLAMES}-{UVES} spectra and analysed these strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance similarities and differences between the M67 stars and the Sun, and among the M67 stars themselves. Individual abundances of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. An exception is Li which shows a considerable scatter among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star abundances to be depleted relative to the abundances in the field stars in correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a tendency earlier found also for the Sun. The results support the hypothesis that the gas of the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was once formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor reductions of heavy elements in the atmospheres of the dwarfs and turn-off point stars relative to our standard star M67-1194 and the subgiants seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars, although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M67 is estimated to be [Fe/H]=+0.06.},

From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main-sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting that the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ∼300 pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations that is created by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.},

It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially.

	abstract = {The double or extended main-sequence turnoffs ({MSTOs}) in the color–magnitude diagram ({CMD}) of intermediate-age massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud are generally interpreted as age spreads of a few hundred Myr. However, such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40–300 Myr), which challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the {MSTOs} of star clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation on the main-sequence lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a fainter and redder {MSTO} with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer {MSTO} when age is larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the {MSTO} caused by a typical rotation rate is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could lead to the double or extended {MSTOs} in the {CMD} of the star clusters with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant, and it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution, and the rotationally induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters, but younger clusters would have an extended {MSTO}. Moreover, the effects of rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some “multiple populations” in globular clusters.},

Until now, the study of stellar shapes has only been possible with optical interferometry for a few of the fastest-rotating nearby stars. We report an asteroseismic measurement, with much better precision than interferometry, of the asphericity of an A-type star with a rotation period of 100 days. Using the fact that different modes of oscillation probe different stellar latitudes, we infer a tiny but significant flattening of the star's shape of ΔR/R = (1.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6) × 10−6. For a stellar radius R that is 2.24 times the solar radius, the difference in radius between the equator and the poles is ΔR = 3 {\textbackslash}pm 1 km. Because the observed ΔR/R is only one-third of the expected rotational oblateness, we conjecture the presence of a weak magnetic field on a star that does not have an extended convective envelope. This calls to question the origin of the magnetic field.},

The current work is the second of this series, where we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 132,921 main-sequence F and G stars and late subgiant stars. Rotation-period candidates are obtained by combining wavelet analysis with autocorrelation function. Reliable rotation periods are then selected via a machine-learning ({ML}) algorithm, automatic selection, and complementary visual inspection. The {ML} training data set comprises 26,521 main-sequence K and M stars from Paper I. To supplement the training, we analyze in the same way as Paper I, i.e., automatic selection and visual inspection, 34,100 additional stars. We finally provide rotation periods P rot and associated photometric activity proxy S ph for 39,592 targets. Hotter stars are generally faster rotators than cooler stars. For main-sequence G stars, S ph spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature, while F stars tend to have smaller S ph values in comparison with cooler stars. Overall for G stars, fast rotators are photometrically more active than slow rotators, with S ph saturating at short periods. The combined outcome of the two papers accounts for average P rot and S ph values for 55,232 main-sequence and subgiant {FGKM} stars (out of 159,442 targets), with 24,182 new P rot detections in comparison with {McQuillan} et al. The upper edge of the P rot distribution is located at longer P rot than found previously.},

In this work, we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to reveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler dwarfs and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We find that a linear gyrochronology model, calibrated to fit the period–Teff relationship of the Praesepe cluster, does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late K dwarfs spin more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages, we find that late K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same age. This result agrees qualitatively with semiempirical models that vary the rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the {NGC} 6811 cluster, which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch of inhibited evolution. We find that the oldest Kepler stars with measured rotation periods are late K and early M dwarfs, indicating that these stars maintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive stars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we confirm that many rapidly rotating {GKM} dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.},

	abstract = {Recent observations show He- and N-enhancements in fast rotating O-type stars, while studies on shear mixing in rotating stars have shown that the μ-gradients generally inhibit mixing processes. However, these studies (including ours) ignored the other sources of turbulence, such as semiconvection and horizontal turbulence, which may be present in the medium and may modify the onset of shear mixing. Indeed, in massive stars most of the zone where μ-gradients would inhibit mixing according to the Richardson criterion is semiconvective, i.e. such a zone would experience some turbulence anyway. This leads us to introduce the following working hypothesis: in a semiconvection region (or in any zone with other sources of turbulence) some fraction of the local energy excess in the shear is degraded by turbulence to change the local entropy gradient. Consistently with this hypothesis we derive the effects of the shear on the entropy gradient, then on the T- and μ-gradients, and express the fraction of the μ-gradient which can be diffused. From the basic equations describing the evolution of temperature perturbations we obtain the velocities of fluid elements under some specific conditions, and then we get the associated diffusion coefficient D. Interestingly enough, the values of D tend towards the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection, when the shears become negligible, and towards the coefficient by Zahn (1992A\&amp;A...265..115Z; cf. also Maeder and Meynet 1996A\&amp;A...313..140M) when shears dominate. We also examine the coupling of shear mixing and thermal transport; a third order equation expressing the combined effects is obtained. The solutions for shears in semiconvective and radiative zones are examined in detail. The main result of the above developments is the slight progressive erosion of the μ-barriers in stars, for cases where the usual form of the Richardson criterion would have imposed an insuperable threshold. In Appendices A and B we rediscuss the diffusion coefficient for semiconvection and find a more general expression, not limited to the adiabatic case.},

	abstract = {Oscillating red-giant stars have provided a wealth of asteroseismic information regarding their interiors and evolutionary states, which enables detailed studies of the Milky Way. The objective of this work is to determine what fraction of red-giant stars shows photometric rotational modulation, and understand its origin. One of the underlying questions is the role of close binarity in this population, which relies on the fact that red giants in short-period binary systems (less than 150 days or so) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We selected a sample of about 4500 relatively bright red giants observed by Kepler, and show that about 370 of them (∼8\%) display rotational modulation. Almost all have oscillation amplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them are not oscillating at all. Of the 85 of these red giants with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up radial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of spectroscopic binarity. Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 nonoscillators are in this group of binaries. On the contrary, about 85\% of the active red giants with detectable oscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of the stellar masses and evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, we shed light on the origin of their activity. It appears that low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while intermediate-mass ones tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true for helium-core burning (red clump) stars, whereby the lower-mass clump stars are comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones are less active. In other words, we find that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they evolve to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend observed with low-mass stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment or other merging events during the shell-burning phase. Regarding intermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods that we measured are long with respect to theoretical expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the existence of an unidentified sink of angular momentum after the main sequence. This article establishes strong links between rotational modulation, tidal interactions, (surface) magnetic fields, and oscillation suppression. There is a wealth of physics to be studied in these targets that is not available in the Sun.},

	abstract = {The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature–period diagram at ∼20 days for G dwarfs and up to ∼30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textbackslash}textgreater10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the {ZTF} archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26\%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with {MEarth}, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G {BP} − G {RP} ∼ 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core–envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

The initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the {ZAMS} ranges from zero to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 70 \% of break-up. Redistribution of angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of rotationally induced circulation and instablities. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of 1E16...1E17 erg s. These values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to break-up. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of young pulsars is discussed.},

The range of light curve and periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multi-period stars may be an indication of different noise characteristics of {TESS}, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of M star rotation rates. About 13\% of the stars have an infrared ({IR}) excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation rates of stars in {UCL}/{LCC} has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the timescale on which the star responds to unlocking.},

To emphasize the signature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both data sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing season.

The phase difference between the two time series reveals that the variability in fast-rotating active stars is usually in anti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in phase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the active stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active stars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less-active stars are dominated by bright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination to be at the Vaughan–Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterConclusions}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater We conclude that faculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages ≳2.55 Gyr.

	abstract = {Stellar surface rotation carries information about stellar parameters—particularly ages—and thus the large rotational datasets extracted from Kepler timeseries represent powerful probes of stellar populations. In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such datasets with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias and confusion to predict the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard "vanilla" assumptions. We arrive at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and observational uncertainties. By assuming that the amplitude and thus detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number, we show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent "Rossby edge" at \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\} = 2.08{\textbackslash}, above which long-period, high-Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\}{\textbackslash} is comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed the onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified braking is in operation in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity at a very similar Rossby number. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing scenarios. (abridged)},

	abstract = {Recent measurements of rotation periods () in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), {NGC} 6811 (1 Gyr), and {NGC} 752 (1.4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass–period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the K2 mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7 Gyr old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the Kepler data for the approximately coeval cluster {NGC} 6819 (30 stars with M⋆ {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.85 ), our new measurements more than double the number of ≈2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to ≈0.55 . The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 {\textbackslash}pm 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the Kepler intermediate-period gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which stars resume spinning down and find that 0.55 stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core–envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out.},

	abstract = {{RADIO} pulsars are thought to born with spin periods of 0.02-0.5 s and space velocities of 100-1000 km/s, and they are inferred to have initial dipole magnetic fields of 10ˆ\{11\}-10ˆ\{13\}. The average space velocity of a normal star in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.},

With a new method that combines autocorrelation and wavelet decomposition, we measure 361 rotation periods from the full set of 17 377 oscillating red giants in our sample. This represents 2.08\% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected rapidly rotating giants in the field. The remaining stars do not show enough variability to allow us to measure a reliable surface rotation period. Because the stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can infer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively evaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of mass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881 intermediate-mass stars, M {\textbackslash}textgreater 2.0 M from our full red giant sample, we do not find the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum conservation. We therefore suggest that either enhanced angular momentum loss or radial differential rotation must be occurring in these stars. Finally, when we examine the 575 low-mass (M {\textbackslash}textless 1.1 M ) red clump stars in our sample, which were expected to exhibit slow (non-detectable) rotation, 15\% of them actually have detectable rotation. This suggests a high rate of interactions and stellar mergers on the red giant branch.},

We concentrate on the waves excited by core convection in a 3Msun, Pop I main sequence star. Here, we want to examine the role of the Coriolis acceleration in the equations of motion that describe the behavior of waves and to evaluate its impact on angular momentum transport. We use the so-called traditional approximation of geophysics, which allows variable separation in radial and horizontal components. In the presence of rotation, the horizontal structure is described by Hough functions instead of spherical harmonics. The Coriolis acceleration has two main effects on waves. It transforms pure gravity waves into gravito-inertial waves that have a larger amplitude closer to the equator, and it introduces new waves whose restoring force is mainly the conservation of vorticity. Taking the Coriolis acceleration into account changes the subtle balance between prograde and retrograde waves in non-rotating stars. It also introduces new types of waves that are either purely prograde or retrograde. We show in this paper where the local deposition of angular momentum by such waves is important.},

In this study, we cross match the Kepler data with li-rich giants catalog from {LAMOST}, and obtain 619 common sources. Then we measure 36 rotation periods from the full set of 295 li-rich giants with good data quality which consists of two sub-samples. The rotation periods of 14 stars was extracted from 205 stars with evolutionary stages determined using asteroseismology, including 11 core helium-burning stars ({HeBs}), 2 red giant branch stars ({RGBs}), and 1 unclassified star. All the super lithium-rich giant stars (A(Li){\textbackslash}textgreater3.3 dex) are {HeBs} in our sample. The remaining 90 giants do not have evolutionary stages confirmed, and in this sub-sample, 22 giants have their rotation period measured. The rotation detection rate of the former sub-sample is 6.8\%, which is significantly higher than the detection rate of a large giant sample in previous studies (2.08\%). With the surface rotation period measured, we confirm the relation between stellar rotation and lithium enrichment of giants. Meanwhile, we find that the less Li-enriched stars have a relatively dispersed distribution of rotation periods, and the giants with a high Li enrichment is concentrated on the rapidly rotating area, which is consistent with earlier studies. The present work also shows a jump at A(Li)≈3.3 dex in the relation between rotation period and Li abundance that coincidently is the boundary between Li-rich giants and super Li-rich giants which may indicate the different mechanisms. The rotation periods of super Li-rich giants become shorter as the lithium enrichment increases. This correlation provides an evidence for the rotational induced extra-mixing mechanism responsible for Li enrichment of giants.},

	doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201629187},
	abstract = {Context. Rotation is one of the key physical mechanisms that deeply impact the evolution of stars. Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of angular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Aims. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating, stably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modelled and its strength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent transport is anisotropic. So far only phenomenological prescriptions have been proposed for the transport in the horizontal direction. This, however, constitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar hydrodynamics in evolution codes. We aim to improve its modelling. Methods. We derived a new theoretical prescription for the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral formalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification, rotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent transport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of the radial differential rotation is derived. We implemented this framework in the stellar evolution code {STAREVOL} and quantified its impact on the rotational and structural evolution of solar metallicity low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red giant branch. Results. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as N ⁴ τ ² /(2Ω ² ), N and Ω being the buoyancy and rotation frequencies respectively and τ a time characterizing the source of turbulence. This leads to a horizontal turbulent transport of similar strength in average that those obtained with previously proposed prescriptions even if it can be locally larger below the convective envelope. Hence the models computed with the new formalism still build up too steep internal rotation gradients compared to helioseismic and asteroseismic constraints. As a consequence, a complementary transport mechanism such as internal gravity waves or magnetic fields is still needed to explain the observed strong transport of angular momentum along stellar evolution. Conclusions. The new prescription links for the first time the anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones to their stratification and rotation. This constitutes important theoretical progress and demonstrates how turbulent closure models should be improved to get firm conclusions on the potential importance of other processes that transport angular momentum and chemicals inside stars along their evolution.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismology allows us to probe stellar interiors. Mixed modes can be used to probe the physical conditions in red giant cores. However, we still need to identify the physical mechanisms that transport angular momentum inside red giants, leading to the slow-down observed for the red giant core rotation. Thus large-scale measurements of the red giant core rotation are of prime importance to obtain tighter constraints on the efficiency of the internal angular momentum transport, and to study how this efficiency changes with stellar parameters. This work aims at identifying the components of the rotational multiplets for dipole mixed modes in a large number of red giant oscillation spectra observed by Kepler. Such identification provides us with a direct measurement of the red giant mean core rotation. We compute stretched spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed modes with same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants. We obtained mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 {\textbackslash}M\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot\}{\textbackslash}, allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow down, our results suggest rotation to be constant along the red giant branch, with values independent on the mass.},

Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence. Results. We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as M˙ ∝ R2 Ω1.33 M−3.36. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age. Conclusions. There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

	abstract = {Context. Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to probe the internal rotation profile of low-mass ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and red giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation, the core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main sequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than observed. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking place in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature of the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar interiors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational coupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the magnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular momentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree of internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a dependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial rotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data is obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the ratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the convective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3. This scaling is consistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions. We show that an angular momentum transport process whose efficiency varies during the stellar evolution through a dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required to explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of low-mass stars.},

We examine the case of solar-twins as well as thousands of synthetic time-series of solar-like stars rotating faster than the Sun. In the case of solar twins we assume that the Gaia unfiltered photometric passband G will mimic the variability of the total solar irradiance ({TSI}) as measured by the {VIRGO} experiment. For stars rotating faster than the Sun, light-curves are simulated using synthetic spectra for the quiet atmosphere, the spots, and the faculae combined by applying semi-empirical relationships relating the level of photospheric magnetic activity to the stellar rotation and the Gaia instrumental response. The capabilities of the Deeming, Lomb-Scargle, and Phase Dispersion Minimisation methods in recovering the correct rotation periods are tested and compared. The false alarm probability ({FAP}) is computed using Monte Carlo simulations and compared with analytical formulae. The Gaia scanning law makes the rate of correct detection of rotation periods strongly dependent on the ecliptic latitude (beta). We find that for P {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1 d, the rate of correct detection increases with ecliptic latitude from 20-30 per cent at beta {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\} to a peak of 70 per cent at beta=45\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\}, then it abruptly falls below 10 per cent at beta {\textbackslash}textgreater 45\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\}.

The long-period pileup is well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, with a critical value of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Ro\_\{crit\}\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashlesssim 2{\textbackslash}. The long-period pileup was predicted by van Saders et al. (2019) as a consequence of weakened magnetic braking, in which wind-driven angular momentum losses cease once stars reach a critical Rossby number. Stars in the long-period pileup are found to have a wide range of ages (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 2-6{\textbackslash}Gyr), meaning that, along the pileup, rotation period is strongly predictive of a star's surface temperature but weakly predictive of its age. The short-period pileup, which is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, is not a prediction of the weakened magnetic braking hypothesis but may instead be related to a phase of slowed surface spin-down due to core-envelope coupling. The same mechanism was proposed by Curtis et al. (2020) to explain the overlapping rotation sequences of low-mass members of differently aged open clusters. The relative dearth of stars with intermediate rotation periods between the short- and long-period pileups is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, which aligns with the period gap initially discovered by {McQuillan} et al. (2013a) in M-type stars. These observations provide further support for the hypothesis that the period gap is due to stellar astrophysics, rather than a non-uniform star-formation history in the Kepler field.},

	abstract = {We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including {PMS} to {ZAMS} spin up, prompt {ZAMS} spin down, and the early-{MS} convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.},

In this paper, we use data from Gaia {DR}2 to reassess the memberships of seven open clusters with ground- and space-based rotational data, and present an updated view of stellar rotation as a function of mass and age. We use the Gaia astrometry to identify the cluster members in phase space, and the photometry to derive revised ages and place the stars on a consistent mass scale. Applying our membership analysis to the rotational sequences reveals that: (1) the contamination in clusters observed from the ground can reach up to ∼35\%; (2) the overall fraction of rotational outliers decreases substantially when the field contaminants are removed, but some outliers persist; (3) there is a sharp upper edge in the rotation periods at young ages; (4) at young ages, stars in the 1.0–0.6Me range inhabit a global maximum of rotation periods, potentially providing an optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a strongly mass-dependent spindown process. In the regime where rapid rotators are leaving the saturated domain, the rotational distributions broaden (in contradiction with popular models), which we interpret as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as those obtained from space.},

Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and medium-strong spectral lines using {MARCS} model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Non-{LTE} effects are considered and taken into account for some of the elements. In addition, precise (σ 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log g – Teff diagram. Results. It is confirmed that the ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same [X/Fe]-{TC} distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the relation between [X/Fe] and {TC} is not well defined. For several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between [X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to ∼0.20 dex over an age interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between [Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are not well correlated with stellar age, but define a tight Ni–Na relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by ∼0.15 dex. Conclusions. The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]– [Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-{TC} relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Aims: We develop a method for estimating the properties of stellar winds for low-mass main-sequence stars between masses of 0.4 and 1.1 solar masses at a range of distances from the star. Methods: We use 1D thermal pressure driven hydrodynamic wind models run using the Versatile Advection Code. Using in situ measurements of the solar wind, we produce models for the slow and fast components of the solar wind. We consider two radically different methods for scaling the base temperature of the wind to other stars: in Model A, we assume that wind temperatures are fundamentally linked to coronal temperatures, and in Model B, we assume that the sound speed at the base of the wind is a fixed fraction of the escape velocity. In Paper {II} of this series, we use observationally constrained rotational evolution models to derive wind mass loss rates. Results: Our model for the solar wind provides an excellent description of the real solar wind far from the solar surface, but is unrealistic within the solar corona. We run a grid of 1200 wind models to derive relations for the wind properties as a function of stellar mass, radius, and wind temperature. Using these results, we explore how wind properties depend on stellar mass and rotation. Conclusions: Based on our two assumptions about the scaling of the wind temperature, we argue that there is still significant uncertainty in how these properties should be determined. Resolution of this uncertainty will probably require both the application of solar wind physics to other stars and detailed observational constraints on the properties of stellar winds. In the final section of this paper, we give step by step instructions for how to apply our results to calculate the stellar wind conditions far from the stellar surface.},

We observe weak trends: e.g. in \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}Teff vs. \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}log g for the {APOGEE}-{GES} stars, and a clear correlation in the vmicro-\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}vmicro planes in the {APOGEE}-{GALAH} common sample. For [\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha{\textbackslash}/H], [Ti/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} giants) and [Al/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} dwarfs) potential strong correlations are discovered as a function of the differences in the main atmospheric parameters, and we find weak trends for other elements. In general we find good agreement between the three surveys within their respective uncertainties. However, there are certain regimes in which strong variants exist, which we discuss. There are still offsets larger than 0.1 dex in the absolute abundance scales.},

	abstract = {Methods. Using the Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale ({AIMS}) stellar parameter inference code, we infer the masses and ages of a set of representative artificial stars for which models were computed with the Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire ({CESTAM}; the T stands for Transport) evolution code, taking into account rotationally induced mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative acceleration. The observed constraints are asteroseismic and classical properties. The grid of stellar models used for the optimization search include neither atomic diffusion nor rotationally induced mixing. The differences between real and retrieved parameters then provide an estimate of the errors made when neglecting transport processes in stellar parameter inference. Results. We show that for masses lower than 1.3 M , rotation dominates the transport of chemical elements and strongly reduces the effect of atomic diffusion, with net surface abundance modifications similar to solar values. At higher mass, atomic diffusion and rotation are competing equally. Above 1.44 M , atomic diffusion dominates in stellar models with initial rotation lower than 80 km s−1 producing a chemical peculiarity which is not observed in Kepler Legacy stars. This indicates that a transport process of chemical elements is missing, probably linked to the missing transport process of angular momentum needed to explain rotation profiles in solar-like stars. Importantly, neglecting rotation and atomic diffusion (including radiative acceleration) in the models, when inferring the parameters of F-type stars, may lead to respective errors of ≈5\%, ≈2.5\%, and ≈25\% for stellar masses, radii, and ages. Conclusions. Atomic diffusion (including radiative acceleration) and rotational mixing should be taken into account in stellar models in order to determine accurate stellar parameters. When atomic diffusion and shellular rotation are both included, they enable stellar evolution codes to reproduce the observed metal and helium surface abundances for stars with masses up to 1.4 M at solar metallicity. However, if rotation is actually uniform for these stars (as observations seem to indicate), then an additional chemical mixing process is needed together with a revised formulation of rotational mixing. For higher masses, an additional mixing process is needed in any case.},

Our stellar property results are consistent with the photometric effective temperatures from the Gaia {DR}2 pipeline. We also measured their chromospheric S and indices to classify the stars as active or inactive and study the connection between chromospheric activity and starspots. We then inferred the starspot covering fractions on the active stars by modeling their spectra as a linear combination of hot and cool inactive stellar spectral templates. We find that it is critical to use precise colors of the stars to place stringent priors on the plausible spot covering fractions. The inferred spot covering fractions generally increase with the chromospheric activity indicator , though we are largely insensitive to spot coverages smaller than {fS} ≲ 20\%.

This also influences the information that we derive through spectroscopic analysis. In this study, we analyze high-resolution spectra of 211 sunlike stars observed at different phases of their activity cycles, in order to investigate how stellar activity affects the spectroscopic determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances. We observe that the equivalent widths of lines can increase as a function of the activity index log R during the stellar cycle, which also produces an artificial growth of the stellar microturbulence and a decrease in effective temperature and metallicity. This effect is visible for stars with activity indexes log R (i.e., younger than 4–5 Gyr), and it is more significant at higher activity levels. These results have fundamental implications on several topics in astrophysics that are discussed in the paper, including stellar nucleosynthesis, chemical tagging, the study of Galactic chemical evolution, chemically anomalous stars, the structure of the Milky Way disk, stellar formation rates, photoevaporation of circumstellar disks, and planet hunting.},

We also investigated the possibility of finding the known clusters in the {APOGEE} {DR}16 red clump sample with 18 chemical species. For both purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space. Results. Even if the internal coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap in the chemical signatures of the clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and no field stars, we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40\% threshold of homogeneity and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use clusters with 7 or more members. In the {APOGEE} sample, field stars are present along with four populated clusters. In this case, only one of the open clusters was moderately recovered. Conclusions. In our best-case scenario, more than 70\% of the groups of stars are in fact statistical groups that contain stars belonging to different real clusters. This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters dissolved in the field are slim, even with the most advanced clustering techniques. We show that different stellar birth sites can have overlapping chemical signatures, even when high-resolution abundances of many different nucleosynthesis channels are used. This is substantial evidence against the possibility of strong chemical tagging. However, we can hope to recover some particular birth clusters that stand out at the edges of the chemical distribution.},

	abstract = {Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of {AFGKM} stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand {iSpec}, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and executing a careful spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before trusting their own results or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.},

This is the largest sample of rotation periods for a cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate a number of relations between rotation period, color and the amplitude of photometric variability. Stars with M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.8 Msun show a tight correlation between period and mass with heavier stars rotating more rapidly. There is a group of 4 stars with P {\textbackslash}textgreater 15 days that fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution. Below 0.8 Msun the stars continue to follow the period-mass correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to shorter periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with observations of other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower-main sequence stellar angular momentum evolution. We find that the model reproduces the observations for solar mass stars, but discrepancies are apparent for stars with 0.6 {\textbackslash}textasciitilde{\textbackslash}textless M {\textbackslash}textasciitilde{\textbackslash}textless 1.0 Msun. We also find that for late-K through early-M dwarf stars in this cluster rapid rotators tend to be bluer than slow rotators in B-V but redder than slow rotators in V-I\_\{C\}. This result supports the hypothesis that the significant discrepancy between the observed and predicted temperatures and radii of low-mass main sequence stars is due to stellar activity.},

	abstract = {A number of recently discovered extrasolar planet candidates have surprisingly small orbits, which may indicate that considerable orbital migration takes place in protoplanetary systems. A natural consequence of orbital migration is for a series of planets to be accreted, destroyed, and then thoroughly mixed into the convective envelope of the central star. We study the ramifications of planet accretion for the final main-sequence metallicity of the star. If maximum disk lifetimes are on the order of ∼ 10 Myr, stars with masses near 1.0 M, are predicted to have virtually no metallicity enhancement. On the other hand, early F- and late A-type stars with masses M∗ ≈ 1.5–2.0 M, can experience significant metallicity enhancements due to their considerably smaller convection zones during the first 10 Myr of pre–main-sequence evolution. We show that the metallicities of an aggregate of unevolved F stars are consistent with an average star accreting ∼ 2 Jupiter-mass planets from a protoplanetary disk having a 10 Myr dispersal time.},

Ninety-two images were obtained during this period through an intermediate band filter centered at 815.9 nm. More than 1500 sources with I magnitudes between 12.5 and 20 were monitored. We find that essentially every star brighter than 16th mag (where the precision is {\textbackslash}textless0.01 mag) is a variable, with about half having a peak-to-peak variation of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.2 mag or more. A clear correlation is found between the level of variability and infrared excess emission, in the sense that stars with evidence for circumstellar disks have larger amplitudes of variation. A search for periodic variables was carried out and 369 such stars were discovered, most or all of which are rotating, spotted T Tauri stars. Periodic variables are most commonly found among the low amplitude variables. 46\% of the stars with magnitudes between 12.5 and 16 and standard deviation, {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterσ{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless 0.1 mag, were found to be periodic, whereas only 24\% of the stars in the same magnitude range with yielded periods. Our work confirms the existence of a bimodal period distribution, with peaks near 2 and 8 days, for stars with and a unimodal distribution peaked near 2 days, for lower mass stars. We show that a statistically significant correlation exists between infrared excess emission and rotation in the sense that slower rotators are more likely to show evidence of circumstellar disks. Slowly rotating stars, with angular velocities, {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}textgreaterω{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textless 1 radian/d, corresponding to rotation periods longer than 6.28 d, have a mean infrared excess emission, , indicative of the presence of inner disks, while rapid rotators, with radians/d, corresponding to rotation periods shorter than 3.14 d, have a much smaller mean of . This supports the hypothesis that disks are involved in regulating stellar rotation during the pre-main sequence phase. We explore a simple and commonly adopted model of rotational evolution in which stars conserve angular velocity while locked to a disk and conserve angular momentum once released. If these assumptions are valid, and if the locking period is 8 days, we find that more than half of the stars in the {ONC} are no longer locked to disks and that an exponential decay model with a disk-locking half-life of about 0.5–1 My fits the observations well. Assuming that the mean ages of the higher and lower mass stars are the same, the faster rotation of the lower mass stars can be understood as either a consequence of a shorter disk-locking time or a shorter initial disk-locking period, or both.},

	abstract = {Rotation is one of the key stellar parameters which undergo substantial evolution during the stellar lifetime, in particular during the early stages. Stellar rotational periods can be determined on the basis of the periodic modulation of starlight produced by non-uniformities on the surface of the stars, due to manifestation of stellar activity. We present the results of an extensive search for rotational periods among {NGC} 2264 cluster members, based on photometric monitoring using the {CoRoT} satellite, with a particular attention to the distribution of classical and weak-line T-Tauri stars. {NGC} 2264 is one of the nearest and best studied star forming region in the solar neighbourhood, with an estimated age of 3 Myr, and is the object of a recent simultaneous multiband campaign including a new {CoRoT} observation with the aim to assess the physical origin of the observed variability. We find that the rotational distributions of classical and weak-line T-Tauri star are different, suggesting a difference in the rotational properties of accreting and non-accreting stars.},

We have obtained {VLT}/{FLAMES}-{UVES} spectra and analysed these strictly differentially in order to explore chemical-abundance similarities and differences between the M67 stars and the Sun, and among the M67 stars themselves. Individual abundances of 19 different chemical elements are obtained for the stars. They are found to agree very well with solar abundances, with abundance ratios closer to solar than those of most solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. An exception is Li which shows a considerable scatter among the cluster stars. There is a tendency for the cluster-star abundances to be depleted relative to the abundances in the field stars in correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements, a tendency earlier found also for the Sun. The results support the hypothesis that the gas of the proto-cluster was depleted by formation and cleansing of dust before the stars formed. They also add support to the proposal that the Sun was once formed in a dense stellar environment. Moreover, the observed minor reductions of heavy elements in the atmospheres of the dwarfs and turn-off point stars relative to our standard star M67-1194 and the subgiants seem to suggest that diffusion processes are at work in these stars, although the evidence is not compelling. Based on theoretical models the diffusion-corrected initial metallicity of M67 is estimated to be [Fe/H]=+0.06.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are at the heart of the observed stellar activity in late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the interface layer between the radiative and the convective stellar regions. Since dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the {ATON} 2.3 stellar code allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable mathematical and numerical challenges involved. As examples, we present theoretical estimates for both the local (tau\_c) and global (tau\_g) convective turnover times for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment. Those estimates, this quantities can be used to calculate the Rossby number, Ro, which is related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity. More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against observations. Our theoretical values of tau\_c, tau\_g and Ro qualitatively agree with those published by Kim \& Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection efficiency, tau\_g decreases for a given mass. {FST} models show still lower values. The presence of rotation shifts tau\_g towards slightly higher values when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions in the models yields values of tau\_g smaller than in the gray approximation.},

This first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in {NGC} 6530, the young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly uniform for 0.5 days {\textbackslash}textless P {\textbackslash}textless 10 days; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level (log {LX} /L bol ≈ -3.3). However, we find a significant positive correlation between {LX} /L bol and corotation radius, suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in {NGC} 6530 is broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster ({ONC}), but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the {ONC} and other young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we argue that {NGC} 6530 may be slightly younger than the {ONC}, making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young, low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Using data from the {HATNet} survey for transiting exoplanets we measure photometric rotation periods for 368 Pleiades stars with 0.4 Msun {\textbackslash}textless M {\textbackslash}textless 1.3 Msun. We detect periodic variability for 74\% of the cluster members in this mass range that are within our field-of-view, and 93\% of the members with 0.7 Msun {\textbackslash}textless M {\textbackslash}textless 1.0 Msun. This increases, by a factor of five, the number of Pleiades members with measured periods. Included in our sample are 14 newly identified probable cluster members which have proper motions, photometry, and rotation periods consistent with membership. We compare this data to the rich sample of spectroscopically determined projected equatorial rotation velocities (vsini) available in the literature for this cluster. For stars with M {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.85 Msun the rotation periods, vsini and radius estimates are consistent with the stars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate differential rotation law is assumed. For stars with M {\textbackslash}textless 0.85 Msun the inferred sini values are systematically larger than 1.0. These observations imply that the combination of measured parameters P(vsini)/R is too large by {\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 24\% for low-mass stars in this cluster. By comparing our new mass-period relation for the Pleiades to the slightly older cluster M35, we confirm previous indications that the spin-down stalls at {\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 100 Myr for the slowest rotating stars with 0.7 Msun {\textbackslash}textless M {\textbackslash}textless 1.1 Msun a fact which may indicate that the internal transport of angular momentum is inefficient in slowly rotating solar mass stars.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for the evolution of gas phase metallicity gradients in galaxies from first principles. We show that metallicity gradients depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration time-scale, production, transport, consumption, and loss. Our model finds that most galaxy metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts. When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations. We also predict the evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both matched stellar masses and matched abundances. Our model shows that massive galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence. Lastly, we show that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be in equilibrium. In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.},

It is shown that the average rotational velocity is higher among those with Ca ii emission than among those without. Since there is strong evidence that stars with Ca ii emission are younger, on the average, than most solar-type stars, a picture is advanced in which rotation declines with advancing age. It is proposed that magnetically coupled winds, similar to the solar wind, are responsible for this deceleration even after a star takes up residence on the main sequence. The winds are presumably generated only in stars which have subsurface hydrogen convection zones and concomitant chromospheres. Estimates of rotational velocity among solar-type stars in the Hyades and Pleiades are given which confirm this general picture. It is shown that the mean rotation in the Pleiades is highest of all groups considered and averages about 40 km/sec for stars of mass 1.20 o. The time scale for reduction by a factor of 2 of the rotational velocities of Pleiades stars is equal to the age of the Hyades, about 4 X 108 years.},

We report rotation periods for 441 stars within this field and determine their cluster membership and binarity based on a decade-long radial velocity survey, proper-motion measurements, and multiband photometric observations. We find that 310 of the stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. The distribution of rotation periods for cluster members span more than 2 orders of magnitude from ∼0.1 to 15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the timespan of the survey. With an age between the zero-age main sequence and the Hyades, and with ∼6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80\% of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color–period plane, and define clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The M35 color–period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition between the two rotational states, of ∼60 Myr and ∼140 Myr for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades, confirm the Skumanich spin-down dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the rotational sequences in the M35 color–period diagram support the use of rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use such gyrochronology to determine “gyro-ages” for M35 from 134 Myr to 161 Myr. We use the M35 data to evaluate new color dependences for the rotational isochrones.},

We determined accurate rotation periods for more than 120 sources whose cluster membership was confirmed by common proper motion and colour-magnitude fits to the clusters' isochrones. This allowed us to determine the effect of magnetic braking on a wide range of spectral types for expected ages of ∼600 Myr for the Hyades and Praesepe. Both clusters show a tight and nearly linear relation between J-Ks colour and rotation period in the F, G and K spectral range. This confirms that loss of angular momentum was significant enough that stars with strongly different initial rotation rates have converged to the same rotation period for a given mass, by the ages of Hyades and Praesepe. In the case of the Hyades, our colour-period sequence extends well into the M dwarf regime and shows a steep increase in the scatter of the colour-period relation, with identification of numerous rapid rotators from ∼0.5 M⊙ down to the lowest masses probed by our survey (∼0.25 M⊙). This provides crucial constraints on the rotational braking time-scales and further clears the way to use gyrochronology as an accurate age measurement tool for main-sequence stars.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \&amp; Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

This concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed mass during the pre-{MS}. These spots decrease the luminosity and Teff of stars, leading to a displacement on the {HR} diagram. This displacement causes isochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can lead to the spurious appearance of an age spread in a co-eval population.},

The coupling between the shears and their effects on the T-gradient must be accounted for. When this is done, we obtain a new more complete criterion, in which the shear properties essentially depend on one critical dimensionless number θ. We must distinguish the cases of radiative and semiconvective zones. For a radiative zone, the stability criterion becomes (1)/(4) (({dU})/(dz))ˆ2ˆ{\textbackslash}textless(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_). If this condition is not realized, we show that there is always a range of scales in the turbulent spectrum where shear instabilities occur. The corresponding diffusion coefficient, depending only on θ, is given. In a semiconvective zone, the stability criterion, with respect to shears, is (1)/(4) (({dU})/(dz))ˆ2ˆ{\textbackslash}textless(gφ∇mu\_)/(H\_p\_)-(1)/(1+2sqrt(6)) (gδ)/(H\_p\_) (∇\_rad\_-∇\_ad\_). We also derive the appropriate diffusion coefficient when the above criterion is not satisfied. Different ranges of turbulent scales may also exist, depending on θ. Interestingly enough, we may notice that the above criterion is also that expressing the transition from shear to semiconvective instabilities.},

These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. In particular, the decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B sugergiants can now be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines. Including a centrifugal force (in the equatorial plane) decreases the terminal velocity and increases the massloss rate, but neither effect is measurable in current data.},

	abstract = {Main-sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging in age from 50 to 350 Myr, how broadband {UBV} color–color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This {UBV} color–color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B − V) and estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on parallaxes from Gaia data release 2 find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older ({\textbackslash}textgreater100 Myr) clusters, such as the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method find that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within ∼10\% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30\%–80\% younger. This illustrates the importance of rotation in deriving ages in the youngest ({\textbackslash}textless100 Myr) clusters.},

	abstract = {Aims: We study the evolution of stellar rotation and wind properties for low-mass main-sequence stars. Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to constrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their properties evolve with time on the main-sequence. Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed rotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters in our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar mass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed in Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the main-sequence. Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters as \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstar {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ2 {\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ\{1.33\} M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashstarˆ\{-3.36\}{\textbackslash}. We estimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to the wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of this change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the spread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at a given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age. Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution of stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of stellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the sensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions, these uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution of planetary environments.},

We apply two statistical tests to the data: a Kolomorgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test sensitive to the behavior around the sample median, and Monte Carlo tests of the probability to draw the observed number of outliers from the theoretical distributions. We find from a K-S test that in the absence of any correction for chemical evolution, the Ryan, Norris, \& Beers ({RNB}) sample is fully consistent with mild rotational mixing induced depletion and, therefore, with an initial lithium abundance higher than the observed value. Tests for outliers depend sensitively on the threshold for defining their presence, but we find a 10\%-45\% probability that the {RNB} sample is drawn from the rotationally mixed models with a 0.2 dex median depletion with lower probabilities corresponding to higher depletion factors. Including or excluding the one upper limit in the sample changes the absolute probabilities but does not affect the overall conclusions. When chemical evolution trends (Li/H vs. Fe/H) are included in our analysis we find that the dispersion in the {RNB} sample is not explained by chemical evolution; the inferred bounds on lithium depletion from rotational mixing are similar to those derived from models without chemical evolution. Finally, we explore the differences between the {RNB} sample and other halo star data sets. We find that differences in the equivalent width measurements are primarily responsible for different observational conclusions concerning the lithium dispersion in halo stars. The different data sets are all consistent with mild stellar depletion, but the systematic errors arising from different observational data sets are a major component of the error budget and need to be addressed. The implications for cosmology are discussed. We find that the standard big bang nucleosynthesis predicted lithium abundance that corresponds to the deuterium abundance inferred from observations of high-redshift, low-metallicity {QSO} absorbers requires halo star lithium depletion in an amount consistent with that from our models of rotational mixing but inconsistent with no depletion.},

From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, {LX} /L {bolvpropRoβ}, is fit as β = -2.70 {\textbackslash}pm 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = -2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/Ω{vpropΩ}0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro {\textbackslash}textless 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many {MCMC} methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, {HMC}'s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashepsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler ({NUTS}), an extension to {HMC} that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. {NUTS} uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, {NUTS} perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard {HMC} method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashepsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. {NUTS} can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. {NUTS} is also suitable for applications such as {BUGS}-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

The results indicate that that there is indeed an age-metallicity relation present in the thick disk. By dividing the stellar sample into sub-groups, separated by 0.1 dex in metallicity, we show that the median age decreases by about 5–7 Gyr when going from [Fe/H] ≈ −0.8 to [Fe/H] ≈ −0.1. Combining our results with our newly published α-element trends for a local sample of thick disk stars that show signatures from supernovae type Ia ({SN} Ia), we draw the conclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the {SN} Ia rate is of the order of 3–4 Gyr in the thick disk. The tentative evidence for a thick disk {AMR} that we present here also has implications for the thick disk formation scenario; star-formation must have been an ongoing process for several billion years. This appears to strengthen the hypothesis that the thick disk originated from a merger event with a companion galaxy that puffed up a pre-existing thin disk.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented to compute age estimates from theoretical isochrones using temperature, luminosity and metallicity data for individual stars. Based on Bayesian probability theory, this method avoids the systematic biases affecting simpler strategies and provides reliable estimates of the age probability distribution function for late-type dwarfs. Basic assumptions concerning the a priori parameter distribution suitable for the solar neighbourhood are combined with the likelihood assigned to the observed data to yield the complete posterior age probability. This method is especially relevant for G dwarfs in the 3–15 Gyr range of ages, crucial to the study of the chemical and dynamical history of the Galaxy. In many cases, it yields markedly different results from the traditional approach of reading the derived age from the isochrone nearest to the data point. We show that the strongest process affecting the traditional approach is that of strongly favouring computed ages near the end-of-main-sequence lifetime. The Bayesian method compensates for this potential bias and generally assigns much higher probabilities to lower main-sequence ages, compared with short-lived evolved stages. This has a strong influence on any application to galactic studies, especially given the present uncertainties on the absolute temperature scale of the stellar evolution models. In particular, the known mismatch between the model predictions and the observations for moderately metal-poor dwarfs (−1 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; −0.3) has a dramatic effect on the traditional age determination.We apply our method to the classic sample of Edvardsson et al., who derived the age–metallicity relation ({AMR}) of 189 field dwarfs with precisely determined abundances. We show how much of the observed scatter in the {AMR} is caused by the interplay between the systematic biases affecting the traditional age determination, the colour mismatch with the evolution models and the presence of undetected binaries. Using new parallax, temperature and metallicity data, our age determination for the same sample indicates that the intrinsic dispersion in the {AMR} is at most 0.15 dex and probably lower. In particular, we show that old, metal-rich objects ([Fe/H]∼ 0.0 dex, age \&gt; 5 Gyr) and young, metal-poor objects ([Fe/H] \&lt; −0.5 dex, age \&lt; 6 Gyr) in many observed {AMR} plots are artefacts caused by too simple a treatment of the age determination. The incompatibility of those {AMR} plots with a well-mixed interstellar medium may therefore only be apparent. Incidentally, our results tend to restore confidence in the method of age determination from the chromospheric activity for field dwarfs.},

The average space velocity of a normal star in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on, it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.},

The advent of Gaia and large spectroscopic surveys has now made it possible, in principle, to infer the properties of individual stars, including most exoplanet hosts, to very high precision. However, we show that, in practice, such analyses are limited by uncertainties in both the fundamental scale and our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic uncertainty floor of ≈2.4\% in temperature, ≈2.0\% in luminosity, and ≈4.2\% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest uncertainties of order ≈5\% in mass and ≈20\% in age for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While the radius uncertainties are roughly constant over this range of stars, the model-dependent uncertainties are a complex function of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets and discuss strategies for reducing these uncertainties in the future.},

The abundance analysis uses near-{IR} high-resolution spectra (λ1.5–1.7 μm) from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment survey and derives abundances for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. Our derived stellar parameters and metallicity for 2M08510076+1153115 suggest that this star is a solar twin, exhibiting abundance differences relative to the Sun of ≤0.04 dex for all elements. Chemical homogeneity is found within each class of stars (∼0.02 dex), while significant abundance variations (∼0.05–0.20 dex) are found across the different evolutionary phases; the turnoff stars typically have the lowest abundances, while the {RCs} tend to have the largest. Non-{LTE} corrections to the {LTE}-derived abundances are unlikely to explain the differences. A detailed comparison of the derived Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca abundances with recently published surface abundances from stellar models that include chemical diffusion provides a good match between the observed and predicted abundances as a function of stellar mass. Such agreement would indicate the detection of chemical diffusion processes in the stellar members of M67.},

The absolute {AMRI}, unlike the convective one, stays in the device, displaying a sustained growth that can be experimentally detected. We also study the global {AMRI} in a {TC} flow of finite height using {DNS} and find that its emerging butterfly-type structure – a spatio-temporal variation in the form of upward and downward traveling waves – is in a very good agreement with the linear stability analysis, which indicates the presence of two dominant absolute {AMRI} modes in the flow giving rise to this global butterfly pattern.},

	shorttitle = {The origin of the elements},
	abstract = {This review assesses the current state of knowledge of how the elements were produced in the Big Bang, in stellar lives and deaths, and by interactions in interstellar gas. We begin with statements of fact and discuss the evidence that convinced astronomers that the Sun is fusing hydrogen, that low-mass stars produce heavy elements through neutron capture, that massive stars can explode as supernovae and that supernovae of all types produce new elements. Nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang, through cosmic ray spallation, and in exploding white dwarfs is only ranked below the above facts in certainty because the evidence, while overwhelming, is so far circumstantial. Next, we highlight the flaws in our current understanding of the predictions for lithium production in the Big Bang and/or its destruction in stars and for the production of the elements with atomic number Z∼45 Z∼45 . While the theory that neutron star mergers produce elements through neutron-capture has powerful circumstantial evidence, we are unconvinced that they produce all of the elements past nickel. Also in dispute is the exact mechanism or mechanisms that cause the white dwarfs to explode. It is difficult to determine the origin of rare isotopes because signatures of their production are weak. We are uncertain about the production sites of some lithium and nitrogen isotopes and proton-rich heavy nuclei. Finally, Betelgeuse is probably not the next star to become a supernovae in the Milky Way, in part because Betelgeuse may collapse directly to a black hole instead. The accumulated evidence in this review shows that we understand the major production sites for the elements, but islands of uncertainty in the periodic table exist. Resolving these uncertainties requires in particular understanding explosive events with compact objects and understanding the nature of the first stars and is therefore primed for new discoveries in the next decades. This article is part of the theme issue `Mendeleev and the periodic table'.},

Here I review the phenomenon of starspots on different types of cool stars, observational tools and diagnostic techniques for studying starspots as well as starspot properties including their temperatures, areas, magnetic field strengths, lifetimes, active latitudes and longitudes, etc. Evolution of starspots on various time scales allows us to investigate stellar differential rotation, activity cycles, and global magnetic fields.

We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from {ROSAT}, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and {XMM}-Newton. We have detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164, respectively, have rotation periods, an increase of 6\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes{\textbackslash} relative to what was previously available. We find that at \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}700 Myr, only M dwarfs remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation.

We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80\%) can be identified from Gaia {DR}3 and {APOGEE} criteria – important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real starspot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number.

Starspots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn timescales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut \& Mamajek empirical scale. Starspot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn timescale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling.

	abstract = {The detection of mixed modes in subgiants and red giants by the {CoRoT} and {\textbackslash}textbackslashemph\{Kepler\} space-borne missions allows us to investigate the internal structure of evolved low-mass stars. In particular, the measurement of the mean core rotation rate as a function of the evolution places stringent constraints on the physical mechanisms responsible for the angular momentum redistribution in stars. It showed that the current stellar evolution codes including the modelling of rotation fail to reproduce the observations. An additional physical process that efficiently extracts angular momentum from the core is thus necessary. Our aim is to assess the ability of mixed modes to do this. To this end, we developed a formalism that provides a modelling of the wave fluxes in both the mean angular momentum and the mean energy equations in a companion paper. In this article, mode amplitudes are modelled based on recent asteroseismic observations, and a quantitative estimate of the angular momentum transfer is obtained. This is performed for a benchmark model of 1.3 {\textbackslash}M\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot\}{\textbackslash} at three evolutionary stages, representative of the evolved pulsating stars observed by {CoRoT} and Kepler. We show that mixed modes extract angular momentum from the innermost regions of subgiants and red giants. However, this transport of angular momentum from the core is unlikely to counterbalance the effect of the core contraction in subgiants and early red giants. In contrast, for more evolved red giants, mixed modes are found efficient enough to balance and exceed the effect of the core contraction, in particular in the hydrogen-burning shell. Our results thus indicate that mixed modes are a promising candidate to explain the observed spin-down of the core of evolved red giants, but that an other mechanism is to be invoked for subgiants and early red giants.},

Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf ({WD}) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler–Spruit dynamo). We find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the {RGB} and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early {RGB} of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling {WD} phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum.

Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function ({ACF}) of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {The coeval stars of young open clusters provide insights into the formation of the rotation-activity relationship that elude studies of multi-age field populations. We measure the chromospheric activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr old open cluster {NGC} 3532 in concert with their rotation periods to study the mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population. Using multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with the {AAOmega} spectrograph at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the chromospheric emission ratios for 454 {FGKM} cluster members of {NGC} 3532. The morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image of the cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of 'desaturated transitional rotators' that branches off from the main group of unsaturated {FGK} slow rotators, and from which it is separated by an 'activity gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the rotational gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact, the relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for many additional stars. We then precisely determine these periods from our photometric light curves. Our activity measurements show that all fast rotators of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating that the absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue but an astrophysical fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling us to populate the extended slow rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis of chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables comprehensive insights into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars during the transitional phase between the Pleiades and Hyades age.

The characteristic timescale associated with the angular momentum transport by {IGW} was computed and compared to the contraction timescale throughout the radiative region of stellar models at different evolutionary stages. Results. We show that {IGW} can efficiently counteract the contraction-driven spin up of the core of subgiant stars if the amplitude of the radial-differential rotation (between the center of the star and the top of the radiative zone) is higher than a threshold value. This threshold depends on the evolutionary stage and is comparable to the differential rotation rates inferred for a sample of subgiant stars observed by the satellite Kepler. Such an agreement can therefore be interpreted as the consequence of a regulation mechanism driven by {IGW}. This result is obtained under the assumption of a smooth rotation profile in the radiative region and holds true even if a wide range of values is considered for the parameters of the generation model. In contrast, on the red giant branch, we find that {IGW} remain insufficient, on their own, to explain the observations because of an excessive radiative damping. Conclusions. {IGW} generated by penetrative convection are able to efficiently extract angular momentum from the core of stars on the subgiant branch and accordingly have to be taken into account. Moreover, agreements with the observations reinforce the idea that their effect is essential to regulate the amplitude of the radial-differential rotation in subgiant stars. On the red giant branch, another transport mechanism must likely be invoked.},

	abstract = {While magnetic fields have long been considered to be important for the evolution of magnetic non-degenerate stars and compact stars, it has become clear in recent years that actually all of the stars are deeply affected. This is particularly true regarding their internal angular momentum distribution, but magnetic fields may also influence internal mixing processes and even the fate of the star. We propose a new framework for stellar evolution simulations, in which the interplay between magnetic field, rotation, mass loss, and changes in the stellar density and temperature distributions are treated self-consistently. For average large-scale stellar magnetic fields which are symmetric to the axis of rotation of the star, we derive 1D evolution equations for the toroidal and poloidal components from the mean-field {MHD} equation by applying Alfven's theorem, and a conservative form of the angular momentum transfer due to the Lorentz force is formulated. We implement our formalism into a numerical stellar evolution code and simulate the magneto-rotational evolution of 1.5 M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash} stars. The Lorentz force aided by the \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash} effect imposes torsional Alfven waves propagating through the magnetized medium, leading to near-rigid rotation within the Alfven timescale. Our models with different initial spins and B-fields can reproduce the main observed properties of Ap/Bp stars. Calculations continued to the red-giant regime show a pronounced core-envelope coupling, which reproduces the core and surface rotation periods determined by asteroseismic observations.},

	abstract = {The internal rotation of post-main sequence stars is investigated, in response to the convective pumping of angular momentum toward the stellar core, combined with a tight magnetic coupling between core and envelope. The spin evolution is calculated using model stars of initial mass 1, 1.5, and 5 \{M\}⊙ , taking into account mass loss on the giant branches. We also include the deposition of orbital angular momentum from a sub-stellar companion, as influenced by tidal drag along with the excitation of orbital eccentricity by a fluctuating gravitational quadrupole moment. A range of angular velocity profiles \{\{Ω \}\}(r) is considered in the envelope, extending from solid rotation to constant specific angular momentum. We focus on the backreaction of the Coriolis force, and the threshold for dynamo action in the inner envelope. Quantitative agreement with measurements of core rotation in subgiants and post-He core flash stars by Kepler is obtained with a two-layer angular velocity profile: uniform specific angular momentum where the Coriolis parameter \{Co\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashequiv \{\{Ω \}\}\{τ \}\{con\}≲ 1 (here \{τ \}\{con\} is the convective time), and \{\{Ω \}\}(r){\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto \{r\}-1 where \{Co\}≳ 1. The inner profile is interpreted in terms of a balance between the Coriolis force and angular pressure gradients driven by radially extended convective plumes. Inward angular momentum pumping reduces the surface rotation of subgiants, and the need for a rejuvenated magnetic wind torque. The co-evolution of internal magnetic fields and rotation is considered in Kissin \& Thompson, along with the breaking of the rotational coupling between core and envelope due to heavy mass loss.},

We measured excess equivalent widths of H α, H β, and Ca {II} K based on estimated chromospheric contributions from old and inactive field dwarfs, and excess luminosities are obtained by normalizing bolometric luminosity, for more than 700 late-type stars in these open clusters. Results indicate two activity sequences in cool spot coverage and H α excess emission among {GK} dwarfs in Pleiades and M dwarfs in Praesepe and Hyades, paralleling with well-known rotation sequences. A weak dependence of chromospheric emission on rotation exists among ultrafast rotators in saturated regime with Rossby number Ro ≲ 0.1. In the unsaturated regime, chromospheric and coronal emission show similar dependence on Ro, but with a shift towards larger Ro, indicating chromospheric emission gets easily saturated than coronal emission, and/or convective turnover time-scales based on X-ray data do not work well with chromospheric emission. More interestingly, our analysis shows fully convective slow rotators obey the rotation-chromospheric activity relation similar to hotter stars, confirming the previous finding. We found correlations among H α, H β, and Ca {II} K emissions, in which H α losses are more important than Ca {II} K for cooler and more active stars. In addition, a weak correlation is seen between chromospheric emission and photospheric activity that shows dependence on stellar spectral type and activity level, which provides some clues on how spot configuration varies as a function of mass and activity level.},

	abstract = {The preparation of science objectives of the {ESA}'s {PLATO} space mission will require the implementation of hare-and-hound exercises relying on the massive generation of representative simulated light-curves. We developed a light-curve simulator named the {PLATO} Solar-like Light-curve Simulator ({PSLS}) in order to generate light-curves representative of typical {PLATO} targets, i.e. showing simultaneously solar-like oscillations, stellar granulation, and magnetic activity. At the same time, {PSLS} also aims at mimicking in a realistic way the random noise and the systematic errors representative of the {PLATO} multi-telescope concept. To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant sources of perturbations expected for {PLATO}. From the simulated pixels, we extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated during the in-flight calibration phases. These corrected light-curves are then fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in {PSLS}. We show that the instrumental systematic errors dominate the signal only at frequencies below 20muHz and are found to mainly depend on stellar magnitude and on the detector charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we compared its predictions with observations made by Kepler on three typical targets and found a good qualitative agreement with the observations. {PSLS} reproduces the main properties of expected {PLATO} light-curves. Its speed of execution and its inclusion of relevant stellar signals as well as sources of noises representative of the {PLATO} cameras make it an indispensable tool for the scientific preparation of the {PLATO} mission.},

We explore different additional transport processes for chemicals and for angular momentum such as penetrative convection, tachocline mixing, and additional turbulence. We constrain the resulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation rate and 7Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters with different ages, and the solar surface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology when our models reach the age of the Sun. Results. We show the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of 7Li in pre-main sequence and early main sequence stars. The rotational dependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation between the initial rotation rate and 7Li depletion in our models of solar-type stars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity νadd leads to efficient transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope during the main sequence evolution and to solar-type models that match the observed profile of the Sun. We also self-consistently compute for the first time the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is compatible with helioseismic estimations at the age of the Sun, but we highlight that the associated turbulence does not allow the observed 7Li depletion to be reproduced. The main sequence depletion of 7Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric turbulent mixing below the convective envelope. Conclusions. The need for additional transport processes in stellar evolution models for both chemicals and angular momentum in addition to atomic diffusion, meridional circulation, and turbulent shear is confirmed. We identify the rotational dependence of the penetrative convection as a key process. Two additional and distinct parametric turbulent mixing processes (one for angular momentum and one for chemicals) are required to simultaneously explain the observed surface 7Li depletion and the solar internal rotation profile. We highlight the need of additional constraints for the internal rotation of young solar-type stars and also for the beryllium abundances of open clusters in order to test our predictions.},

	abstract = {Methods. Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were associated to different surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting different periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of different periods to {DR}, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods. Results. In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P1 between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of P1 = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 {\textbackslash}textless B − V {\textbackslash}textless 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P2 within {\textbackslash}pm30\% of the rotation period P1 was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to {DR} we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear α increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear ΔΩ slightly increases from ΔΩ = 0.079 rad d−1 at Teff = 3500 K to ΔΩ = 0.096 rad d−1 at Teff = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, ΔΩ shows much larger scatter. The dependence of ΔΩ on rotation period is weak over a large period range. Conclusions. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory, and seems to support these models. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias has not been fully explored, and needs to be addressed using other data, including the full Kepler time coverage.},

	abstract = {The Kepler space mission has made it possible to measure the rotational splittings of mixed modes in red giants, thereby providing an unprecedented opportunity to probe the internal rotation of these stars. Asymmetries have been detected in the rotational multiplets of several red giants. This is unexpected since all the red giants whose rotation have been measured thus far are found to rotate slowly, and low rotation, in principle, produces symmetrical multiplets. Our aim here is to explain these asymmetries and find a way of exploiting them to probe the internal rotation of red giants. We show that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet asymmetries. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical {\textbackslash}l=2{\textbackslash} multiplets of the Kepler young red giant {KIC}7341231 and obtain precise estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected multiplet asymmetries. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for {\textbackslash}l=2{\textbackslash} mixed modes all along the red giant branch ({RGB}). For {\textbackslash}l=1{\textbackslash} modes, these effects can be neglected only at the base of the {RGB}. They must therefore be taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here, they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.},

Each quarter (Q1–Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally, the full time series and their different segments are analyzed. Results. For more than 18 500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from {McQuillan} et al. (2014, {ApJS}, 211, 24). Of these, more than 12 300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as {DR}. Dependencies of the {DR} with rotation period and effective temperature could be confirmed, e.g., the relative {DR} increases with rotation period. Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17 000 stars using different gyrochronology relations, most of them with uncertainties dominated by period variations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between 3200–4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. Conclusions. The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than ∼93.0\% of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The relation between activity and age is interesting, and requires further investigation. The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable.},

	abstract = {Context. Stellar rotation affects the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum and is therefore a key process during stellar evolution, which is still not fully understood. This is especially true for massive {OB}-type stars, which are important for the chemical enrichment of the Universe. It is therefore important to constrain the physical parameters and internal angular momentum distribution of massive {OB}-type stars to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally split non radial oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars more massive than the Sun. The slowly pulsating B9V star {HD} 201433 is known to be part of a single-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting with periods of about 3.3 and 154 days. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Aims: Our goal is to measure the internal rotation profile of {HD} 201433 and investigate the tidal interaction with the close companion. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Methods: We used probabilistic methods to analyse the {BRITE} - Constellation photometry and radial velocity measurements, to identify a representative stellar model, and to determine the internal rotation profile of the star. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Results: Our results are based on photometric observations made by {BRITE} - Constellation and the Solar Mass Ejection Imager on board the Coriolis satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 yr of radial velocity measurements.

We establish that {HD} 201433 is in principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297 {\textbackslash}pm 76 days. Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of {HD} 201433 is also reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of about 0.9 s during the last 96 yr. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Conclusions: Combining the asteroseismic inferences with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner binary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central {SPB} star and its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit.

	abstract = {Methods. We reanalyze a previously studied sample of 24 124 Kepler stars using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Each quarter (Q1–Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally, the full time series and their different segments are analyzed. Results. For more than 18 500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from {McQuillan} et al. (2014, {ApJS}, 211, 24). Of these, more than 12 300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as {DR}. Dependencies of the {DR} with rotation period and effective temperature could be confirmed, e.g., the relative {DR} increases with rotation period. Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17 000 stars using different gyrochronology relations, most of them with uncertainties dominated by period variations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between 3200–4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. Conclusions. The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than ∼93.0\% of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The relation between activity and age is interesting, and requires further investigation. The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable.},

	abstract = {Context. Stellar rotation affects the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum and is therefore a key process during stellar evolution, which is still not fully understood. This is especially true for massive {OB}-type stars, which are important for the chemical enrichment of the Universe. It is therefore important to constrain the physical parameters and internal angular momentum distribution of massive {OB}-type stars to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally split non radial oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars more massive than the Sun. The slowly pulsating B9V star {HD} 201433 is known to be part of a single-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting with periods of about 3.3 and 154 days. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Aims: Our goal is to measure the internal rotation profile of {HD} 201433 and investigate the tidal interaction with the close companion. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Methods: We used probabilistic methods to analyse the {BRITE} - Constellation photometry and radial velocity measurements, to identify a representative stellar model, and to determine the internal rotation profile of the star. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Results: Our results are based on photometric observations made by {BRITE} - Constellation and the Solar Mass Ejection Imager on board the Coriolis satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 yr of radial velocity measurements. We identify a sequence of nine frequency doublets in the photometric time series, consistent with rotationally split dipole modes with a period spacing of about 5030 s. We establish that {HD} 201433 is in principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297 {\textbackslash}pm 76 days. Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of {HD} 201433 is also reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of about 0.9 s during the last 96 yr. {\textbackslash}{textlessBR} /{\textbackslash}textgreater Conclusions: Combining the asteroseismic inferences with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner binary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central {SPB} star and its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit.

	abstract = {Methods. We use Lomb–Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability range, Rvar, from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution. Results. Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in 29 860 stars. The reliability of these periods was estimated from stars observed more than once. We find that 75–90\% of the stars show period deviation smaller than 20\% between different campaigns, depending on the peak height threshold in the periodograms. For effective temperatures below 6000 K, the variability range shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of ∼750 Myr. Additionally, the rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region in the K2 data is less pronounced compared to the Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. Conclusions. We conclude that the rotation period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability on the rotation period.},

	abstract = {Space-based observations of solar-like oscillations present an opportunity to constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic difference that must be corrected. We introduce and evaluate two parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough (1990). The first we call a cubic term proportional to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnuˆ3/{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash} and the second has an additional inverse term proportional to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnuˆ\{-1\}/{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash}, where \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnu{\textbackslash} and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathcal\{I\}{\textbackslash} are the frequency and inertia of an oscillation mode. We first show that these formulae accurately correct model frequencies of two different solar models ... We then incorporate the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations of the well-studied {CoRoT} target {HD}52265. For comparison, we also run the pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al. (2008). The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for {HD}52265 are consistent with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is significantly worse but yields consistent parameters ... We find that the cubic term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to implement in an existing pipeline. ... This parametrization is thus a useful new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode frequencies can be exploited.},

We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with 2500 K ≤ Teff ≤ 8000 K, −1 ≤ log g = log ({GM}/R2) ≤ 5 (cgs) with various masses and radii, −5 ≤ [Me/H] ≤ +1, with [α/Fe] = 0.0 and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances. This includes “{CN}-cycled” models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 ≤ ξt ≤ 5 km s−1. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T , Pg, Pe, ρ, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and find excellent agreement with planeparallel models of Castelli \& Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric {NextGen} models, the agreement with more recent {PHOENIX} models is gratifying. Conclusions. The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate “rules of thumb” concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

Similar to the Q1-16 catalog by Huber et al., the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted method and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities, or metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ∼27\% in radius, ∼17\% in mass, and ∼51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved \{log\}g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants.

	abstract = {In the last 15 years different ground-based spectroscopic surveys have been started (and completed) with the general aim of delivering stellar parameters and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic stars, complementing Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-{ESO} Public Spectroscopic Survey ({GES}), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target 100,000 stars using {FLAMES} on the {ESO} {VLT} (both Giraffe and {UVES} spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on open star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.) reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data reduction, organisation, and workflow. The {GES} has determined homogeneous good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of its more than 110,000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived for up to 31 elements for targets observed with {UVES}. Lithium abundances are delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been addressed by the Gaia-{ESO} consortium and the community, with many highlight results achieved. The final catalogue has been released through the {ESO} archive at the end of May 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products. In addition to these results, the Gaia-{ESO} Survey will leave a very important legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.},

We extract chromospheric indexes, S and Rhk+, for 59,816 stars from {LAMOST} spectra in the {LAMOST}-Kepler program, and photospheric index, Reff, for 5575 stars from Kepler light curves. The log Reff shows positive correlation with log Rhk+. We estimate the power-law indexes between Reff and Rhk+ for F-, G-, and K-type stars, respectively. We also confirm the dependence of both chromospheric and photospheric activity on stellar rotation. Ca {II} H and K emissions and photospheric variations generally decrease with increasing rotation periods for stars with rotation periods exceeding a few days. The power-law indexes in exponential decay regimes show different characteristics in the two activity-rotation relations.

	abstract = {In this article we first review the main physical effects to be considered in the building of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence ({MS}). The internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion processes, and mass loss. In turn, differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper {MS}, for red giants, supergiants, and W-R stars. A fast rotation enhances the mass loss by stellar winds and, conversely, high mass loss removes a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the breakup or Ω-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be and {LBV} stars. The effects of rotation on the tracks in the {HR} diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue-to-red supergiant ratios, the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars, and the chemical abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and {AGB} stars are reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are examined, along with the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity Ω as well.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation is a strong function of both mass and evolutionary state. Missions such as Kepler and {CoRoT} provide tens of thousands of rotation periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations (∼0.4–2.0 M☉). We find that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence ({MS}) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the {MS} with high rotation rates. Intermediate rotators (10–40 days) can be either cool {MS} dwarfs, suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses. Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There exists a period–age relation for subgiants distinct from the {MS} period–age relations. There is also a period–radius relation that can be used as a constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on the {MS} persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.},

The seismic modeling of young subgiants can be used to obtain indirect constraints on the core structure during main sequence, thanks to the high probing potential of mixed modes. Aims. We selected the young subgiant {KIC}10273246, observed by Kepler , based on its mixed-mode properties. We thoroughly modeled this star, with the aim of placing constraints on the size of its main-sequence convective core. A corollary goal of this study is to elaborate a modeling technique that is suitable for subgiants and can later be applied to a larger number of targets. Methods. We first extracted the parameters of the oscillation modes of the star using the full Kepler data set. To overcome the challenges posed by the seismic modeling of subgiants, we propose a method that is specifically tailored to subgiants with mixed modes and uses nested optimization. We then applied this method to perform a detailed seismic modeling of {KIC}10273246. Results. We obtain models that show good statistical agreements with the observations, both seismic and non-seismic. We show that including core overshooting in the models significantly improves the quality of the seismic fit, optimal models being found for α ov = 0.15. Higher amounts of core overshooting strongly worsen the agreement with the observations and are thus firmly ruled out. We also find that having access to two g -dominated mixed modes in young subgiants allows us to place stronger constraints on the gradient of molecular weight in the core and on the central density. Conclusions. This study confirms the high potential of young subgiants with mixed modes to investigate the size of main-sequence convective cores. It paves the way for a more general study including the subgiants observed with Kepler , {TESS}, and eventually {PLATO}.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismic measurements of the internal rotation of subgiants and red giants all show the need for invoking a more efficient transport of angular momentum than theoretically predicted. Constraints on the core rotation rate are available starting from the base of the red giant branch ({RGB}) and we are still lacking information on the internal rotation of less evolved subgiants. We identified two young Kepler subgiants, {KIC}8524425 and {KIC}5955122, whose mixed modes are clearly split by rotation. Using the full Kepler data set, we extracted the mode frequencies and rotational splittings for the two stars using a Bayesian approach. We then performed a detailed seismic modeling of both targets and used the rotational kernels to invert their internal rotation profiles. We found that both stars are rotating nearly as solid bodies, with core-envelope contrasts of \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm g\}/{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm p\}=0.68{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.47{\textbackslash} for {KIC}8524425 and {\textbackslash}0.72{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.37{\textbackslash} for {KIC}5955122. This result shows that the internal transport of angular momentum has to occur faster than the timescale at which differential rotation is forced in these stars (between 300 Myr and 600 Myr). By modeling the additional transport of angular momentum as a diffusive process with a constant viscosity \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnu\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm add\}{\textbackslash}, we found that values of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnu\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm add\}{\textbackslash}textgreater5{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes10ˆ4\{{\textbackslash}textasciitildecm{\textbackslash}ˆ2{\textbackslash}.s{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash} are required to account for the internal rotation of {KIC}8524425, and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashnu\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm add\}{\textbackslash}textgreater1.5{\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes10ˆ5\{{\textbackslash}textasciitildecm{\textbackslash}ˆ2{\textbackslash}.s{\textbackslash}ˆ\{-1\}{\textbackslash} for {KIC}5955122. These values are lower than or comparable to the efficiency of the core-envelope coupling during the main sequence, as given by the surface rotation of stars in open clusters. On the other hand, they are higher than the viscosity needed to reproduce the rotation of subgiants near the base of the {RGB}. Our results yield further evidence that the efficiency of the internal redistribution of angular momentum decreases during the subgiant phase.},

	abstract = {The plethora of photometric data collected by the Kepler space telescope has promoted the detection of tens of thousands of stellar rotation periods. However, these periods are not found to an equal extent among different spectral types. Interestingly, early G-type stars with near-solar rotation periods are strongly underrepresented among those stars with known rotation periods. In this study we investigate whether the small number of such stars can be explained by difficulties in the period determination from photometric time series. For that purpose, we generate model light curves of early G-type stars with solar rotation periods for different inclination angles, metallicities, and (magnitude-dependent) noise levels. We find that the detectability is determined by the predominant type of activity (i.e., spot or faculae domination) on the surface, which defines the degree of irregularity of the light curve, and further depends on the level of photometric noise. These two effects significantly complicate the period detection and explain the lack of solar-like stars with known near-solar rotation periods. We conclude that the rotation periods of the majority of solar-like stars with near-solar rotation periods remain undetected to date. Finally, we promote the use of new techniques to recover more periods of near-solar rotators.},

	abstract = {Rotational mixing is a prime candidate for explaining the gradual depletion of lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence. However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and stellar data in the sense that they overestimate the internal differential rotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly differentially rotating at young ages but approach a solid body rotation during their lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an additional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for explaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for mixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a ∼20 Myr timescale is required to explain the evolution of the mean rotation pattern along the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate description of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling produces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little mixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr, in agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances we argue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence decreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss the implications of this finding for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic fields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility of intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters using M67 as an example.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01772},
	abstract = {Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars increases over time and adopt an age–velocity–dispersion relation ({AVR}) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an {AVR}. Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an {RMS} of 1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine learning algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the {McQuillian} et al. (2014) catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25\%. Using predicted rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed age–element abundance trends with literature values.},

By crossmatching K2 stars to observations from Gaia Data Release 2, we have identified 69,627 likely main-sequence stars. From these we select a subsample of 8,977 stars on the main-sequence with highly precise rotation period measurements. With this sample we recover the gap in the rotation period-color diagram first reported by {McQuillan} et al. (2013). While the gap was tentatively detected in Reinhold \& Hekker (2020), this work represents the first robust detection of the gap in K2 data. This is significant because K2 observed along many lines of sight at wide angular separation, in contrast to Kepler's single line of sight. We interpret this gap as evidence for a departure from the {\textbackslash}tˆ\{-1/2\}{\textbackslash} Skumanich spin down law rather than an indication of a bimodal star formation history. We provide maximum likelihood estimates and uncertainties for all parameters of the quasi-periodic light curve model for each of the 284,834 stars in our sample.},

	abstract = {We analyzed three years of data from the Kepler space mission to derive rotation periods of main-sequence stars below 6500 K. Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period–temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by {McQuillan} et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M☉. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between ∼950 ppm (5th percentile) and ∼22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of ∼5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above ∼5400 K.},

	abstract = {We present rotation period measurements for subgiants observed by {CoRoT}. Interpreting the modulation of stellar light that is caused by star-spots on the time scale of the rotational period depends on knowing the fundamental stellar parameters. Constraints on the angular momentum distribution can be extracted from the true stellar rotational period. By using models with an internal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of rotation periods of subgiant stars we investigate the agreement between theoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can also reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational period measurements from subgiant light curves. We can prove that an evolution assuming solid body rotation is incompatible with the direct measurement of the rotational periods of subgiant stars. Measuring the rotation periods relies on two different periodogram procedures, the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and the Plavchan periodogram. Angular momentum evolution models were computed to give us the expected rotation periods for subgiants, which we compared with measured rotational periods. We find evidence of a sinusoidal signal that is compatible in terms of both phase and amplitude with rotational modulation. Rotation periods were directly measured from light curves for 30 subgiant stars and indicate a range of 30 to 100 d for their rotational periods. Our models reproduce the rotational periods obtained from {CoRoT} light curves. These new measurements of rotation periods and stellar models probe the non-rigid rotation of subgiant stars.},

This mixed character allows to probe the physical conditions in their core. With the advent of long-duration time series from space-borne missions such as {CoRoT} and {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterKepler}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater, it becomes possible to study the red giant core rotation. As more than 15 000 red giant light curves have been recorded, it is crucial to develop a robust and efficient method to measure this rotation. Such measurements of thousands of mean core rotation would open the way to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms that are able to transport angular momentum from the core to the envelope in red giants. In this work, we detail the principle of the method we developed to obtain automatic measurements of the red giant mean core rotation. This method is based on the stretching of the oscillation spectra and on the use of the so-called Hough transform. We finally validate this method for stars on the red giant branch, where overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings produce complicated frequency spectra.},

	abstract = {Stars of spectral classes A and late B are almost entirely radiative. {CP} stars are a slowly rotating subgroup of these stars. It is possible that they possessed long-lived accretion disks in their T Tauri phase. Magnetic coupling of disk and star leads to rotational braking at the surface of the star. Microscopic viscosities are extremely small and will not be able to reduce the rotation rate of the core of the star. We investigate the question of whether the magneto-rotational instability can provide turbulent angular momentum transport. We discuss whether differential rotation is present in {CP} stars. Numerical {MHD} simulations of thick stellar shells are performed. An initial differential rotation law is subject to the influence of a magnetic field. This configuration does indeed give rise to a magneto-rotational instability. The emerging flows and magnetic fields efficiently transport angular momentum outwards. Weak dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde10{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater-2{\textbackslash}textlesssup/{\textbackslash}textgreater in stars) is found from the simulations. First tests with stratified shells show different flows, but the same efficiency of angular-momentum transport. Since the estimated time-scale of decay of differential rotation is 10{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater7{\textbackslash}textlesssup/{\textbackslash}textgreater–10{\textbackslash}textlesssup{\textbackslash}textgreater8{\textbackslash}textlesssup/{\textbackslash}textgreater yr, and comparable to the life-time of A stars, we find the braking of the core to be an ongoing process in many {CP} stars. The evolution of the surface rotation of {CP} stars with age will be an observational challenge, and of considerable value in verifying these simulations.},

	abstract = {We continue our study of a powerful weak-field {MHD} instability. Consequences of the instability for pressure-supported systems are discussed, with emphasis upon stellar radiative zones. It is suggested that the instability, rather than hydromagnetic waves, is responsible for establishing uniform rotation in weakly magnetized stellar radiative zones. When the Brunt–Väisälä frequency much exceeds the rotation frequency, only displacements in spherical shells are unstable. Thus the transport induced by the instability is tangential and leads to little radial mixing. If angular velocity is initially constant on cylinders, the effect of the instability is to transport angular momentum from the poles to the equator. If angular momentum is locally deposited by thermalization of the instability, this will probably have the effect of establishing solid-body rotation in radiative zones. If angular momentum is not deposited locally, it will tend to accumulate in the mid-plane of the star, with uncertain consequences. It may contribute to an anisotropic wind. A review of the instability in discs is also presented.},

	abstract = {We use Doppler imaging techniques to determine the dependence of starspot rotation rates on latitude in an homogeneous sample of young, rapidly rotating solar analogues. A solar-like differential rotation law is used, where the rotation depends on sin2θ, where θ is the stellar latitude. By including this term in the image reconstruction process, using starspots as tracers, we are able to determine the magnitude of the shear over more than one rotation cycle. We also consider results from matched filter starspot tracking techniques, where individual starspot rotation rates are determined. In addition we have re-analysed published results and present a new measurement for the K3 dwarf Speedy Mic.A total of 10 stars of spectral type G2—M2 are considered. We find a trend towards decreasing surface differential rotation with decreasing effective temperature. The implied approach to solid body rotation with increasing relative convection zone depth implies that the dynamo mechanism operating in low-mass stars may be substantially different from that in the Sun.},

	abstract = {The reason for the observed thinness of the solar tachocline is still not well understood. One of the explanations that have been proposed is that a primordial magnetic field renders the rotation uniform in the radiation zone. We test here the validity of this magnetic scenario through 3D numerical {MHD} simulations that encompass both the radiation zone and the convection zone. The numerical simulations are performed with the anelastic spherical harmonics ({ASH}) code. The computational domain extends from {\textbackslash}0.07{\textbackslash}textbackslash;R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash} to {\textbackslash}0.97{\textbackslash}textbackslash;R\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}. In the parameter regime we explored, a dipolar fossil field aligned with the rotation axis can not remain confined in the radiation zone. When the field lines are allowed to interact with turbulent unstationary convective motions at the base of the convection zone, 3D effects prevent the field confinement. In agreement with previous work, we find that a dipolar fossil field, even when it is initially buried deep inside the radiation zone, will spread into the convective zone. According to Ferraro's law of iso-rotation, it then imprints on the radiation zone the latitudinal differential rotation of the convection zone, which is not observed.},

There is a thin transition layer between these zones, called the tachocline4. This structure has been measured seismologically1,2,3, but no purely fluid-dynamical mechanism can explain its existence. Here we argue that a self-consistent model requires a large-scale magnetic field in the Sun's interior, as well as consideration of the Coriolis effects in the convection zone and in the tachocline. Turbulent stresses in the convection zone induce (through Coriolis effects) a meridional circulation, causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards, thereby generating the horizontal and vertical shear that characterizes the tachocline. The interior magnetic field stops the burrowing, and confines the shear, as demanded by the observed structure of the tachocline. We outline a dynamical theory of the flow, from which we estimate a field strength of about 10−4 tesla just beneath the tachocline. An important test of this picture, after numerical refinement, will be quantitative consistency between the predicted and observed interior angular velocities.},

	abstract = {Context: The observations of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars have brought important constraints on their internal rotation rates. To correctly reproduce these data, an efficient transport mechanism is needed in addition to meridional circulation and shear instability. Aims: We study the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results: The precise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates available for the six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum needed for each of these subgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the uncertainties related to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence phase. An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants (typical values of log(g) close to 4), because their rotational properties are sensitive to the degree of radial differential rotation on the main sequence. These young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain the transport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic observations of evolved stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency of the additional transport process increases with the mass of the star during the subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined mechanism decreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found for red giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that increases with the degree of radial differential rotation cannot account for the core rotation rates of subgiants, while it correctly reproduces the rotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature of the additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum may be different in subgiant and red giant stars.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are at the heart of the observed stellar activity in late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the interface layer between the radiative and the convective stellar regions. Since dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the {ATON} 2.3 stellar code allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable mathematical and numerical challenges involved. As examples, we present theoretical estimates for both the local (tau\_c) and global (tau\_g) convective turnover times for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment. Those estimates, this quantities can be used to calculate the Rossby number, Ro, which is related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity. More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against observations. Our theoretical values of tau\_c, tau\_g and Ro qualitatively agree with those published by Kim \& Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection efficiency, tau\_g decreases for a given mass. {FST} models show still lower values. The presence of rotation shifts tau\_g towards slightly higher values when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions in the models yields values of tau\_g smaller than in the gray approximation.},

	shorttitle = {When Gaussian Process Meets Big Data},
	abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process ({GP}) regression, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable {GPs} have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable {GPs} in the {GP} community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable {GPs} involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable {GPs} are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementation of scalable {GPs} in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

A natural consequence of orbital migration is for a series of planets to be accreted, destroyed, and then thoroughly mixed into the convective envelope of the central star. We study the ramifications of planet accretion for the final main-sequence metallicity of the star. If maximum disk lifetimes are on the order of ∼ 10 Myr, stars with masses near 1.0 M, are predicted to have virtually no metallicity enhancement. On the other hand, early F- and late A-type stars with masses M∗ ≈ 1.5–2.0 M, can experience significant metallicity enhancements due to their considerably smaller convection zones during the first 10 Myr of pre–main-sequence evolution. We show that the metallicities of an aggregate of unevolved F stars are consistent with an average star accreting ∼ 2 Jupiter-mass planets from a protoplanetary disk having a 10 Myr dispersal time.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PhDT........24W},
	abstract = {The thesis topic is the stochastic excitation of the solar p-modes by turbulent convection, and the work consists of four parts: three theoretical sections and one observational. In the first section of the thesis, an explicit calculation of the acoustic radiation of a buoyant oscillating bubble is presented as a model for the excitation of the solar p-modes. The central scientific issue addressed in this work is the cancellation of monopole and dipole radiation fields in an anisotropic medium, first pointed out by Goldreich and Kumar (1990). When the bubble oscillation frequency is small compared to the acoustic cutoff, the monopole and dipole disturbances cancel to the quadrupole order in the far field. The second section deals with the role of convective structures in a wide number of problems, including the creation of acoustic disturbances, the transport of heat and magnetic fields, and the penetration of flows into stable layers of the atmosphere (overshoot). A model of plume convection is developed to discuss these issues. It is argued that the scaleheight-sized flows (the only energetically significant ones) are properly characterized as coherent, entropy-preserving plumes, in contradistinction to the picture of amorphous parcels of fluid suggested by the Mixing Length Theory, and in spite of the large Reynolds numbers typical in astrophysical convection. The third section of the thesis is an analysis of high-resolution surface velocity data taken with a magneto-optical filter on the 10 inch telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Estimates are obtained for the frequencies and amplitudes of the solar oscillations of high spherical harmonic degree (l approximately less than 2000). The observed mode energies follow a Boltzmann distribution (P(E) varies as exp(-E/(bar-E)), as is predicted in the stochastic excitation model. In the final section of the thesis, a derivation of the variational principle for an incompressible fluid is presented. The Lagrange and Hamiltonian densities are calculated to third order in the displacement field, and these results are suitable to study the non-linear interactions among incompressible modes.},

	abstract = {Context. The Kepler space telescope has provided time series of red giants of such unprecedented quality that a detailed asteroseismic analysis becomes possible. For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications. Aims: We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. Methods: We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. Results: We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

To achieve this goal, we adopt the traditional approximation, which can be applied to stellar radiation zones under conditions that are given.

Besides the improvement of observational data, solar seismologists developed sophisticated techniques to infer the internal structure of the Sun. Back in the 1990s these comparisons showed a very high agreement between solar models and the Sun. However, the downward revision of the {CNO} surface abundances in the Sun in 2005, confirmed in 2009, induced a drastic reduction of this agreement leading to the so-called solar modelling problem. More than ten years later, in the era of the space-based photometry missions which have established asteroseismology of solar-like stars as a standard approach to obtain their masses, radii and ages, the solar modelling problem still awaits a solution. I will briefly present the results of new helioseismic inversions, discuss the current uncertainties of solar models and possible solutions to the solar modelling problem. I will also discuss how the solar problem can have significant implications for asteroseismology as a whole by discussing the modelling of the exoplanet-host star Kepler-444, thus impacting the fields requiring a precise and accurate knowledge of stellar masses, radii and ages, such as Galactic archaeology and exoplanetology.},

	abstract = {Multiple codes are available to derive atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances from high-resolution spectra of {AFGKM} stars. Almost all spectroscopists have their own preferences regarding which code and method to use. But the intrinsic differences between codes and methods lead to complex systematics that depend on multiple variables such as the selected spectral regions and the radiative transfer code used. I expand {iSpec}, a popular open-source spectroscopic tool, to support the most well-known radiative transfer codes and assess their similarities and biases when using multiple set-ups based on the equivalent-width method and the synthetic spectral-fitting technique (interpolating from a pre-computed grid of spectra or synthesizing with interpolated model atmospheres). This work shows that systematic differences on atmospheric parameters and abundances between most of the codes can be reduced when using the same method and executing a careful spectral feature selection. However, it may not be possible to ignore the remaining differences, depending on the particular case and the required precision. Regarding methods, equivalent-width-based and spectrum-fitting analyses exhibit large differences that are caused by their intrinsic differences, which is significant given the popularity of these two methods. The results help to identify the key caveats of modern spectroscopy that all scientists should be aware of before trusting their own results or being tempted to combine atmospheric parameters and abundances from the literature.},

So far, no seismic scaling relations for determining the ages of red giant stars have been developed. Such relations would be desirable for galactic archaeology, which uses stellar ages to map the history of the Milky Way. The ages of red giants must instead be estimated with reference to grids of theoretical stellar models, which can be computationally intensive. Here I present an exhaustive search for scaling age relations involving different combinations of observable quantities. The candidate scaling relations are calibrated and tested using more than 1,000 red giant stars whose ages were obtained via grid-based modeling. I report multiple high-quality scaling relations for red giant branch stars, the best of which are shown to be approximately as accurate as grid-based modeling with typical uncertainties of 15\%. Additionally, I present new scaling mass and radius relations for red giants as well.},

We then inferred the starspot covering fractions on the active stars by modeling their spectra as a linear combination of hot and cool inactive stellar spectral templates. We find that it is critical to use precise colors of the stars to place stringent priors on the plausible spot covering fractions. The inferred spot covering fractions generally increase with the chromospheric activity indicator , though we are largely insensitive to spot coverages smaller than {fS} ≲ 20\%.

We also investigated the possibility of finding the known clusters in the {APOGEE} {DR}16 red clump sample with 18 chemical species. For both purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space. Results. Even if the internal coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap in the chemical signatures of the clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and no field stars, we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40\% threshold of homogeneity and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use clusters with 7 or more members. In the {APOGEE} sample, field stars are present along with four populated clusters. In this case, only one of the open clusters was moderately recovered. Conclusions. In our best-case scenario, more than 70\% of the groups of stars are in fact statistical groups that contain stars belonging to different real clusters. This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters dissolved in the field are slim, even with the most advanced clustering techniques. We show that different stellar birth sites can have overlapping chemical signatures, even when high-resolution abundances of many different nucleosynthesis channels are used. This is substantial evidence against the possibility of strong chemical tagging. However, we can hope to recover some particular birth clusters that stand out at the edges of the chemical distribution.},

We report that star spot measurements in the Praesepe open cluster are strongly enhanced only for stars which depart from standard models of rotational evolution. A decoupling of the spin down history between the core and envelope explains both the activity and rotation anomalies: surface rotational evolution is stalled by interior angular momentum redistribution, and the resultant radial shears enhance star spot activity. These anomalies provide evidence for an evolving front of shear-enhanced activity affecting the magnetic and rotational evolution of cool stars and the high-energy environments of their planetary companions for hundreds of millions to billions of years on the main sequence.},

This also influences the information that we derive through spectroscopic analysis. In this study, we analyze high-resolution spectra of 211 sunlike stars observed at different phases of their activity cycles, in order to investigate how stellar activity affects the spectroscopic determination of stellar parameters and chemical abundances. We observe that the equivalent widths of lines can increase as a function of the activity index log R during the stellar cycle, which also produces an artificial growth of the stellar microturbulence and a decrease in effective temperature and metallicity. This effect is visible for stars with activity indexes log R (i.e., younger than 4–5 Gyr), and it is more significant at higher activity levels. These results have fundamental implications on several topics in astrophysics that are discussed in the paper, including stellar nucleosynthesis, chemical tagging, the study of Galactic chemical evolution, chemically anomalous stars, the structure of the Milky Way disk, stellar formation rates, photoevaporation of circumstellar disks, and planet hunting.},

In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta} r=0.001R{\textbackslash} and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of about \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlangle{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_c/2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi{\textbackslash}textbackslashrangle=748{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm18\{{\textbackslash}{textasciitildenHz} and provide evidence for an angular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of the hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning shell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlangle{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_s/2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi{\textbackslash}textbackslashrangle=68{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm22\{{\textbackslash}{textasciitildenHz}. Hence, the core in {KIC}{\textbackslash}textasciitilde4448777 is rotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope. We conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

	abstract = {{SDSS}-{IV} {APOGEE}-2, {GALAH} and Gaia-{ESO} are high resolution, ground-based, multi-object spectroscopic surveys providing fundamental stellar atmospheric parameters and multiple elemental abundance ratios for hundreds of thousands of stars of the Milky Way. We undertake a comparison between the most recent data releases of these surveys to investigate the accuracy and precision of derived parameters by placing the abundances on an absolute scale. We discuss the correlations in parameter and abundance differences as a function of main parameters. Uncovering the variants provides a basis to on-going efforts of future sky surveys. Quality samples from the {APOGEE}-{GALAH}, {APOGEE}-{GES} and {GALAH}-{GES} overlapping catalogs are collected. We investigate the mean variants between the surveys, and linear trends are also investigated. We compare the slope of correlations and mean differences with the reported uncertainties. The average and scatter of vrad, Teff, log g, [M/H] and vmicro, along with numerous species of elemental abundances in the combined catalogs show that in general there is a good agreement between the surveys. We find large radial velocity scatters ranging from 1.3 km/s to 4.4 km/s when comparing the three surveys. We observe weak trends: e.g. in \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}Teff vs. \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}log g for the {APOGEE}-{GES} stars, and a clear correlation in the vmicro-\{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta}{\textbackslash}vmicro planes in the {APOGEE}-{GALAH} common sample. For [\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha{\textbackslash}/H], [Ti/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} giants) and [Al/H] ({APOGEE}-{GALAH} dwarfs) potential strong correlations are discovered as a function of the differences in the main atmospheric parameters, and we find weak trends for other elements. In general we find good agreement between the three surveys within their respective uncertainties. However, there are certain regimes in which strong variants exist, which we discuss. There are still offsets larger than 0.1 dex in the absolute abundance scales.},

The {GSVD} provides rather natural bases with which to express the various properties of the inversion, in particular the solution, the inversion coefficients (which relate the solution to the data) and the averaging kernels (which relate the solution to the underlying unknown function). These facilitate an analysis of resolution and error properties. We apply the theory to a helioseismic example and find inter alia that, for our prototypical problem, there is an effective limit to the information content of the mode set in the presence of reasonable data errors which is much less than might have been expected from the number of modes. We show that various popular inversion methods can be analysed using the tools developed here. We find in our helioseismic application that the methods make very similar use of the data.},

However, their memberships are often heavily contaminated by field stars, which could potentially bias the interpretations. In this paper, we use data from Gaia {DR}2 to reassess the memberships of seven open clusters with ground- and space-based rotational data, and present an updated view of stellar rotation as a function of mass and age. We use the Gaia astrometry to identify the cluster members in phase space, and the photometry to derive revised ages and place the stars on a consistent mass scale. Applying our membership analysis to the rotational sequences reveals that: (1) the contamination in clusters observed from the ground can reach up to ∼35\%; (2) the overall fraction of rotational outliers decreases substantially when the field contaminants are removed, but some outliers persist; (3) there is a sharp upper edge in the rotation periods at young ages; (4) at young ages, stars in the 1.0–0.6Me range inhabit a global maximum of rotation periods, potentially providing an optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a strongly mass-dependent spindown process. In the regime where rapid rotators are leaving the saturated domain, the rotational distributions broaden (in contradiction with popular models), which we interpret as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as those obtained from space.},

The long-period pileup is well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, with a critical value of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{Ro\_\{crit\}\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashlesssim 2{\textbackslash}. The long-period pileup was predicted by van Saders et al. (2019) as a consequence of weakened magnetic braking, in which wind-driven angular momentum losses cease once stars reach a critical Rossby number. Stars in the long-period pileup are found to have a wide range of ages (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 2-6{\textbackslash}Gyr), meaning that, along the pileup, rotation period is strongly predictive of a star's surface temperature but weakly predictive of its age. The short-period pileup, which is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, is not a prediction of the weakened magnetic braking hypothesis but may instead be related to a phase of slowed surface spin-down due to core-envelope coupling. The same mechanism was proposed by Curtis et al. (2020) to explain the overlapping rotation sequences of low-mass members of differently aged open clusters. The relative dearth of stars with intermediate rotation periods between the short- and long-period pileups is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, which aligns with the period gap initially discovered by {McQuillan} et al. (2013a) in M-type stars. These observations provide further support for the hypothesis that the period gap is due to stellar astrophysics, rather than a non-uniform star-formation history in the Kepler field.},

This allows great versatility in the choice of target form, and furthermore {SOLA} has the significant advantage of being computationally more efficient than the usual {OLA} formulations. A Gaussian target function is a useful choice, and we use the example of determining the Sun's internal rotation to explore how the parameter values (such as the Gaussian's width) should best be chosen. Some alternatives to using a Gaussian function as target function are discussed and applied to artificial data in a blind experiment. In particular we show that it is possible to invert directly for the gradient of the rotation. This may be of interest if there are localized large gradients in the rotation rate.},

We examine the case of solar-twins as well as thousands of synthetic time-series of solar-like stars rotating faster than the Sun. In the case of solar twins we assume that the Gaia unfiltered photometric passband G will mimic the variability of the total solar irradiance ({TSI}) as measured by the {VIRGO} experiment. For stars rotating faster than the Sun, light-curves are simulated using synthetic spectra for the quiet atmosphere, the spots, and the faculae combined by applying semi-empirical relationships relating the level of photospheric magnetic activity to the stellar rotation and the Gaia instrumental response. The capabilities of the Deeming, Lomb-Scargle, and Phase Dispersion Minimisation methods in recovering the correct rotation periods are tested and compared. The false alarm probability ({FAP}) is computed using Monte Carlo simulations and compared with analytical formulae. The Gaia scanning law makes the rate of correct detection of rotation periods strongly dependent on the ecliptic latitude (beta). We find that for P {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1 d, the rate of correct detection increases with ecliptic latitude from 20-30 per cent at beta {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\} to a peak of 70 per cent at beta=45\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\}, then it abruptly falls below 10 per cent at beta {\textbackslash}textgreater 45\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashdeg\}.

Non-{LTE} effects are considered and taken into account for some of the elements. In addition, precise (σ 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log g – Teff diagram. Results. It is confirmed that the ratio between refractory and volatile elements is lower in the Sun than in most of the solar twins (only one star has the same [X/Fe]-{TC} distribution as the Sun), but for many stars, the relation between [X/Fe] and {TC} is not well defined. For several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between [X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to ∼0.20 dex over an age interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation between [Fe/H] and age. While [Mg/Fe] increases with age, the s-process element yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that [Y/Mg] can be used as a sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution. The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are not well correlated with stellar age, but define a tight Ni–Na relation similar to that previously found for more metal-poor stars albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O ratio evolves very little with time, although [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] change by ∼0.15 dex. Conclusions. The dependence of [X/Fe] on stellar age and the [Ni/Fe]– [Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the [X/Fe]-{TC} relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.},

However, we still need to identify the physical mechanisms that transport angular momentum inside red giants, leading to the slow-down observed for the red giant core rotation. Thus large-scale measurements of the red giant core rotation are of prime importance to obtain tighter constraints on the efficiency of the internal angular momentum transport, and to study how this efficiency changes with stellar parameters. This work aims at identifying the components of the rotational multiplets for dipole mixed modes in a large number of red giant oscillation spectra observed by Kepler. Such identification provides us with a direct measurement of the red giant mean core rotation. We compute stretched spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed modes with same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants. We obtained mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 {\textbackslash}M\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot\}{\textbackslash}, allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow down, our results suggest rotation to be constant along the red giant branch, with values independent on the mass.},

	abstract = {A common method to infer that solar properties vary with position is to compare linear estimates of averages of those properties centered at different locations. If some of the confidence intervals for the averages do not overlap, one concludes that the property varies. In order for this conclusion to be statistically valid, the lengths of the intervals must be adjusted to obtain the correct "simultaneous coverage probability." We illustrate the notion of simultaneous coverage probability using coin tossing as an example. We present four methods for adjusting the lengths of confidence intervals for linear estimates, and a complementary approach to infer changes based on constructing a linear estimator that is directly sensitive to changes. The first method for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals is based on Bonferroni's inequality, and applies generally to confidence intervals for any set of parameters, from dependent or independent observations. The second method is based on a 2 measure of fit to the data, which allows one to compute s1multaneous confidence intervals for any number of linear functionals of the model. The third method uses a ˆ\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}2 {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}distribution in the space of estimates, which yields "Scheffe'" confidence intervals for the functionals. The fourth method, which produces the shortest confidence intervals, uses the infinity-norm in the space of estimates to construct "maximum-modulus" confidence intervals. We apply the four methods to search for radial changes in averages of solar angular velocity, using data from Big Bear Solar Observatory ({BBSO}) averaged for the 4 yr 1986, 1988-1990. Finally, we apply the new differencing estimator to the {BBSO} data, finding strong evidence that the average solar angular velocity is lower near the poles than near the equator over a range of depths, as is observed at the surface as well.},

	abstract = {Context. Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to probe the internal rotation profile of low-mass ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and red giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation, the core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main sequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than observed. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking place in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature of the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar interiors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational coupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the magnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular momentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree of internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a dependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial rotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data is obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the ratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the convective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3. This scaling is consistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions. We show that an angular momentum transport process whose efficiency varies during the stellar evolution through a dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required to explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of low-mass stars.},

Aspects of 'standard' solar evolution are discussed along with questions regarding the choice of an appropriate standard, the solar neutrino problem, solar oscillations, the variations of the solar luminosity, and the solar cycle. It is found that standard solar models are apparently a good approximation to the gross structure of the sun. They can be constructed to reproduce the observed solar luminosity and radius, and with a chemical composition that is not considered abnormal by most astrophysicists they can reproduce quite well the frequencies of the five minute oscillations, for modes of both high and low degree. The only severe point of disagreement might be the neutrino flux, but the theoretical predictions of that flux are presently in doubt.},

In this study, we cross match the Kepler data with li-rich giants catalog from {LAMOST}, and obtain 619 common sources. Then we measure 36 rotation periods from the full set of 295 li-rich giants with good data quality which consists of two sub-samples. The rotation periods of 14 stars was extracted from 205 stars with evolutionary stages determined using asteroseismology, including 11 core helium-burning stars ({HeBs}), 2 red giant branch stars ({RGBs}), and 1 unclassified star. All the super lithium-rich giant stars (A(Li){\textbackslash}textgreater3.3 dex) are {HeBs} in our sample. The remaining 90 giants do not have evolutionary stages confirmed, and in this sub-sample, 22 giants have their rotation period measured. The rotation detection rate of the former sub-sample is 6.8\%, which is significantly higher than the detection rate of a large giant sample in previous studies (2.08\%). With the surface rotation period measured, we confirm the relation between stellar rotation and lithium enrichment of giants. Meanwhile, we find that the less Li-enriched stars have a relatively dispersed distribution of rotation periods, and the giants with a high Li enrichment is concentrated on the rapidly rotating area, which is consistent with earlier studies. The present work also shows a jump at A(Li)≈3.3 dex in the relation between rotation period and Li abundance that coincidently is the boundary between Li-rich giants and super Li-rich giants which may indicate the different mechanisms. The rotation periods of super Li-rich giants become shorter as the lithium enrichment increases. This correlation provides an evidence for the rotational induced extra-mixing mechanism responsible for Li enrichment of giants.},

	abstract = {Recent measurements of rotation periods () in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), {NGC} 6811 (1 Gyr), and {NGC} 752 (1.4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass–period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the K2 mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7 Gyr old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the Kepler data for the approximately coeval cluster {NGC} 6819 (30 stars with M⋆ {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.85 ), our new measurements more than double the number of ≈2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to ≈0.55 . The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 {\textbackslash}pm 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the Kepler intermediate-period gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which stars resume spinning down and find that 0.55 stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core–envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out.},

Many stars besides the Sun may also be amenable to asteroseismic analysis. Stars of roughly solar type should of course behave in ways similar to the sun, and stars of this sort form a large fraction of the potential targets for asteroseismology. But several other types of stars (delta scuti stars, {roAP} stars, and the pulsating white dwarfs) also have the desired pulsation characteristics. Pulsations in some of these stars are, for various reasons, much easier to observe than in the Sun-like stars. Virtually all unambiguous observations of multi-mode pulsators relate to these other categories of stars. Since oscillation mode frequencies are arguably the most precise measurement relating to a star that we can make, a few tens of such frequencies may still be of great importance to our understanding of the stellar structure and evolution.},

With a new method that combines autocorrelation and wavelet decomposition, we measure 361 rotation periods from the full set of 17 377 oscillating red giants in our sample. This represents 2.08\% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected rapidly rotating giants in the field. The remaining stars do not show enough variability to allow us to measure a reliable surface rotation period. Because the stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can infer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively evaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of mass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881 intermediate-mass stars, M {\textbackslash}textgreater 2.0 M from our full red giant sample, we do not find the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum conservation. We therefore suggest that either enhanced angular momentum loss or radial differential rotation must be occurring in these stars. Finally, when we examine the 575 low-mass (M {\textbackslash}textless 1.1 M ) red clump stars in our sample, which were expected to exhibit slow (non-detectable) rotation, 15\% of them actually have detectable rotation.

We find that {TESS} has a greater than 50\% chance of detecting 260 of these planets at the 3σ level in one sector of observations and an additional 120 planets in two sectors. Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only ∼5\% of known multiply transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect {TESS} to be a powerful tool to characterize transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 ({KOI}-142) as an example, we show that {TESS} will improve measurements of planet–star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Because {TESS} will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether {TESS} will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems.

	abstract = {Stellar surface rotation carries information about stellar parameters—particularly ages—and thus the large rotational datasets extracted from Kepler timeseries represent powerful probes of stellar populations. In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such datasets with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias and confusion to predict the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard "vanilla" assumptions. We arrive at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is complicated by mixtures of unevolved and evolved stars and observational uncertainties. By assuming that the amplitude and thus detectability of rotational signatures is tied to the Rossby number, we show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent "Rossby edge" at \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\} = 2.08{\textbackslash}, above which long-period, high-Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextrm\{Ro\}\_\{thresh\}{\textbackslash} is comparable to the Rossby number at which van Saders et al. (2016) observed the onset of weakened magnetic braking, and suggests either that this modified braking is in operation in the full Kepler population, or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity at a very similar Rossby number. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing scenarios. (abridged)},

	abstract = {Context. The signatures of nonlinear effects affecting stellar oscillations are difficult to observe from ground observatories because of the lack of continuous high-precision photometric data spanning extended enough time baselines. The unprecedented photometric quality and coverage provided by the Kepler spacecraft offers new opportunities to search for these phenomena. Aims: We use the Kepler data accumulated on the pulsating {DB} white dwarf {KIC} 08626021 to explore in detail the stability of its oscillation modes, searching, in particular, for evidence of nonlinear behaviors. Methods: We analyze nearly two years of uninterrupted short-cadence data, concentrating on identified triplets that are caused by stellar rotation and that show intriguing behaviors during the course of the observations. Results: We find clear signatures of nonlinear effects that could be attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. These couplings occur between the components of the triplets and can induce different types of behaviors. We first notice that a structure at 3681 μHz, identified as a triplet in previous published studies, is in fact forming a doublet, with the third component being an independent mode. We find that a triplet at 4310 μHz and this doublet at 3681 μHz (most likely the two visible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear periodic frequency and amplitude modulations, which are typical of the so-called intermediate regime of the resonance, with timescales consistent with theoretical expectations. Another triplet at 5073 μHz is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the amplitudes are modulated while the frequencies are locked. Using nonadiabatic pulsation calculations, based on a model representative of {KIC} 08626021 to evaluate the linear growth rates of the modes in the triplets, we also provide quantitative information that could be useful for future comparisons with numerical solutions of the amplitude equations. Conclusions: The observed modulations are the clearest hints of nonlinear resonant couplings occurring in white dwarf stars identified so far. These should resonate as a warning to projects that aim at measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of {KIC} 08626021, and of white dwarf stars in general. Nonlinear modulations of the frequencies can potentially jeopardize any attempt to measure such rates reliably, unless they can be corrected beforehand. These results should motivate further theoretical work to develop the nonlinear stellar pulsation theory.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterContext}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater The study of stellar activity cycles is crucial to understand the underlying dynamo and how it causes magnetic activity signatures such as dark spots and bright faculae. Having knowledge about the dominant source of surface activity might allow us to draw conclusions about the stellar age and magnetic field topology, and to put the solar cycle in context.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterAims}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater We investigate the underlying process that causes magnetic activity by studying the appearance of activity signatures in contemporaneous photometric and chromospheric time series.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterMethods}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used to search for cycle periods present in the photometric and chromospheric time series. To emphasize the signature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both data sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing season. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the phase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time series simultaneously using the same cycle period.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterResults}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater We find cycle periods in 27 of the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series reveals that the variability in fast-rotating active stars is usually in anti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in phase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the active stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active stars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less-active stars are dominated by bright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination to be at the Vaughan–Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one.{\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterConclusions}.{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater We conclude that faculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages ≳2.55 Gyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan–Preston gap cannot explain the previously detected dearth of {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterKepler}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater rotation periods between 15 and 25 days. Nevertheless, our results led us to propose an explanation for the lack of rotation periods to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the cancelation of dark spots and bright faculae at ∼800 Myr.},

We find spot-modulated periods (P) for {\textbackslash}textasciitilde90\% of members. The range of light curve and periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multi-period stars may be an indication of different noise characteristics of {TESS}, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of M star rotation rates. About 13\% of the stars have an infrared ({IR}) excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation rates of stars in {UCL}/{LCC} has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the timescale on which the star responds to unlocking.},

	abstract = {The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature–period diagram at ∼20 days for G dwarfs and up to ∼30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textbackslash}textgreater10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the {ZTF} archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26\%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with {MEarth}, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G {BP} − G {RP} ∼ 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core–envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

	abstract = {Oscillating red-giant stars have provided a wealth of asteroseismic information regarding their interiors and evolutionary states, which enables detailed studies of the Milky Way. The objective of this work is to determine what fraction of red-giant stars shows photometric rotational modulation, and understand its origin. One of the underlying questions is the role of close binarity in this population, which relies on the fact that red giants in short-period binary systems (less than 150 days or so) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We selected a sample of about 4500 relatively bright red giants observed by Kepler, and show that about 370 of them (∼8\%) display rotational modulation. Almost all have oscillation amplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them are not oscillating at all. Of the 85 of these red giants with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up radial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of spectroscopic binarity. Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 nonoscillators are in this group of binaries. On the contrary, about 85\% of the active red giants with detectable oscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of the stellar masses and evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, we shed light on the origin of their activity. It appears that low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while intermediate-mass ones tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true for helium-core burning (red clump) stars, whereby the lower-mass clump stars are comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones are less active. In other words, we find that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they evolve to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend observed with low-mass stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment or other merging events during the shell-burning phase. Regarding intermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods that we measured are long with respect to theoretical expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the existence of an unidentified sink of angular momentum after the main sequence. This article establishes strong links between rotational modulation, tidal interactions, (surface) magnetic fields, and oscillation suppression. There is a wealth of physics to be studied in these targets that is not available in the Sun.},

	abstract = {The rotational evolution of cool dwarfs is poorly constrained after ∼1–2 Gyr due to a lack of precise ages and rotation periods for old main-sequence stars. In this work, we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to reveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler dwarfs and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We find that a linear gyrochronology model, calibrated to fit the period–Teff relationship of the Praesepe cluster, does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late K dwarfs spin more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages, we find that late K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same age. This result agrees qualitatively with semiempirical models that vary the rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the {NGC} 6811 cluster, which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch of inhibited evolution. We find that the oldest Kepler stars with measured rotation periods are late K and early M dwarfs, indicating that these stars maintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive stars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we confirm that many rapidly rotating {GKM} dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.},

The current work is the second of this series, where we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 132,921 main-sequence F and G stars and late subgiant stars. Rotation-period candidates are obtained by combining wavelet analysis with autocorrelation function. Reliable rotation periods are then selected via a machine-learning ({ML}) algorithm, automatic selection, and complementary visual inspection. The {ML} training data set comprises 26,521 main-sequence K and M stars from Paper I. To supplement the training, we analyze in the same way as Paper I, i.e., automatic selection and visual inspection, 34,100 additional stars. We finally provide rotation periods P rot and associated photometric activity proxy S ph for 39,592 targets. Hotter stars are generally faster rotators than cooler stars. For main-sequence G stars, S ph spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature, while F stars tend to have smaller S ph values in comparison with cooler stars. Overall for G stars, fast rotators are photometrically more active than slow rotators, with S ph saturating at short periods. The combined outcome of the two papers accounts for average P rot and S ph values for 55,232 main-sequence and subgiant {FGKM} stars (out of 159,442 targets), with 24,182 new P rot detections in comparison with {McQuillan} et al.

	abstract = {By considering stellar models with the same interior structure but different outer layers we demonstrate that the ratio of the small to large separations of acoustic oscillations in solar-like stars is essentially independent of the structure of the outer layers, and is determined solely by the interior structure. Defining the scaled Eulerian pressure perturbation psil (omega ,t) = r p' /(rho c)1/2 we define the internal phase shift deltal (omega ,t) through the relation omega psi /(dpsi /dt)=tan (omega t -pil /2 + deltal ). The deltal are almost independent of acoustic radius t=int dr/c outside the stellar core and can be determined as a continuous functions of omega from partial wave solutions for the interior - that is solutions of the oscillation equations for any omega that satisfy the Laplace boundary condition at a sufficiently large acoustic radius tf outside the stellar core. If the omega are eigenfrequencies then they satisfy the Eigenfrequency Equation omega T=(n+l/2) pi +alpha (omega )-deltal (omega ) where alpha (omega ) is the l independent surface phase shift (Roxburgh \& Vorontsov 2000). Using this result we show that the ratio of small to large separations is determined to high accuracy solely by the internal phase shifts deltal (omega ) and hence by the interior structure alone. The error in this result is estimated and shown to be smaller than that associated with the errors in the determination of the frequencies ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde0.1-0.3 mu Hz) from the upcoming space missions {MOST}, {COROT} and Eddington.},

However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods {\textbackslash}textgreater10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility ({ZTF}).

This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core–envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

	abstract = {We have studied solar-like oscillations in {\textbackslash}textasciitilde800 red giant stars using Kepler long-cadence photometry. The sample includes stars ranging in evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency separation (Δν) and the frequency of maximum power (νmax) and show that it is different for red giants than for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models and scaling relations. The distributions of νmax and Δν are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a secondary clump population characterized by M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 2 M sun and νmax {\textbackslash}textasciitilde= 40-110 μHz. We measured the small frequency separations δν02 and δν01 in over 400 stars and δν03 in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation ratios δν02/Δν and δν01/Δν have opposite trends as a function of Δν. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward lower νmax, in agreement with models predicting more efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with Δν, demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first amplitude-νmax relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a lack of low-amplitude stars for νmax {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 110 μHz and find that, for a given νmax between 40 and 110 μHz, stars with lower Δν (and consequently higher mass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher Δν.},

	abstract = {The double or extended main-sequence turnoffs ({MSTOs}) in the color–magnitude diagram ({CMD}) of intermediate-age massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud are generally interpreted as age spreads of a few hundred Myr. However, such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40–300 Myr), which challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the {MSTOs} of star clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation on the main-sequence lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a fainter and redder {MSTO} with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer {MSTO} when age is larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the {MSTO} caused by a typical rotation rate is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could lead to the double or extended {MSTOs} in the {CMD} of the star clusters with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant, and it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution, and the rotationally induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters, but younger clusters would have an extended {MSTO}. Moreover, the effects of rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some “multiple populations” in globular clusters.},

	abstract = {Context. The {CoRoT} 5-month long observation runs provide us with the opportunity to analyze a large variety of red-giant stars and derive their fundamental parameters from their asteroseismic properties. Aims: We perform an analysis of more than 4600 {CoRoT} light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of both the star sample and the method to ensure that our asteroseismic results are as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants in two opposite regions of the Galaxy. Methods: We analyze the time series using the envelope autocorrelation function to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean wide frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of the maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius. Results: We identify more than 1800 red giants among the 4600 light curves and obtain accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We are able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We derive precise information about the stellar population distribution and the red clump. By comparing the stars observed in two different fields, we find that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but that the characteristics are different for red-clump stars. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficiency of statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer fundamental stellar parameters, derive precise information about red-giant evolution and interior structure, analyze and compare stellar populations from different fields.

We report an asteroseismic measurement, with much better precision than interferometry, of the asphericity of an A-type star with a rotation period of 100 days. Using the fact that different modes of oscillation probe different stellar latitudes, we infer a tiny but significant flattening of the star's shape of ΔR/R = (1.8 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6) × 10−6. For a stellar radius R that is 2.24 times the solar radius, the difference in radius between the equator and the poles is ΔR = 3 {\textbackslash}pm 1 km. Because the observed ΔR/R is only one-third of the expected rotational oblateness, we conjecture the presence of a weak magnetic field on a star that does not have an extended convective envelope. This calls to question the origin of the magnetic field.},

We show that the difference of the Δν-νmax relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

	abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations δL/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy (δL/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be δL/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., α Cen A and β Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

Further, the rotational decay curve is found to satisfy the same law. It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca+ emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root. The above results are predicated Qi' the standard Hyades age (0.4 billion years).},

In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum (νmax) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off frequency (νc). Using the {SoHO} {GOLF} observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between νmax and νc, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.},

However, in the last 30 years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

The extended data strengthen the relationship between chromospheric and brightness variability at visible wavelengths derived previously. We show that the full range of photometric variation has probably now been observed for a majority of the program stars. Twenty-seven stars are deemed variable according to an objective statistical criterion. On a year-to-year timescale, young active stars become fainter when their Ca {II} emission increases, while older less active stars such as the Sun become brighter when their Ca {II} emission increases. The Sun's total irradiance variation, scaled to the b and y stellar filter photometry, still appears to be somewhat smaller than stars in our limited sample with similar mean chromospheric activity, but we now regard this discrepancy as probably due mainly to our limited stellar sample.},

Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior.},

A total of 1299 bright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good astrometric solutions, most with temperatures above 5000 K. From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main-sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting that the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ∼300 pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations that is created by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.},

	abstract = {Core rotation rates have been measured for red giant stars using asteroseismology. These data, along with helioseismic measurements and open cluster spin-down studies, provide powerful clues about the nature and timescale for internal angular momentum transport in stars. We focus on two cases: the metal-poor red giant {KIC} 7341231 ("Otto") and intermediate-mass core helium burning stars. For both, we examine limiting case studies for angular momentum coupling between cores and envelopes under the assumption of rigid rotation on the main sequence. We discuss the expected pattern of core rotation as a function of mass and radius. In the case of Otto, strong post-main-sequence coupling is ruled out and the measured core rotation rate is in the range of 23-33 times the surface value expected from standard spin-down models. The minimum coupling timescale (0.17-0.45 Gyr) is significantly longer than that inferred for young open cluster stars. This implies ineffective internal angular momentum transport in early first ascent giants. By contrast, the core rotation rates of evolved secondary clump stars are found to be consistent with strong coupling given their rapid main-sequence rotation. An extrapolation to the white dwarf regime predicts rotation periods between 330 and 0.0052 days, depending on mass and decoupling time. We identify two key ingredients that explain these features: the presence of a convective core and inefficient angular momentum transport in the presence of larger mean molecular weight gradients. Observational tests that can disentangle these effects are discussed.},

The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by {McQuillan} et al., is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is clearly recovered for stars out to 525 pc, but is not detectable at farther distances. We find the bimodality is correlated with height above the Galacitc plane, with the ratio of rapidly rotating younger stars dropping strongly for stars above Z {\textbackslash}textgreater 90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of Δ{MG} ∼ 0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient may indicate that main-sequence evolution produces offsets in color–magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.},

Aims: We want to reproduce the observed rotation profile of the early red giant {KIC} 7341231 through modeling and constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. Methods: We computed models of {KIC} 7341231 including a treatment of shellular rotation, and we compared the rotation profiles obtained with the one derived from observations. We then modify some modeling parameters in order to quantify their effect on the obtained rotation profile. Moreover, we mimicked a powerful angular momentum transport during the main sequence and studied its effect on the evolution of the rotation profile during the subgiant and red giant phases. Results: We show that meridional circulation and shear mixing alone produce a rotation profile for {KIC} 7341231 that is too steep compared to the observed one. An additional mechanism is then needed to increase the internal transport of angular momentum. We find that this undetermined mechanism has to be efficient not only during the main sequence but also during the much quicker subgiant phase. Moreover, we point out the importance of studying the whole rotational history of a star to explain its rotation profile during the red giant evolution.},

The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which can be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to be an accurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of rotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A prominent observational feature of the mass–rotation period diagrams of open clusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and persistence of this slow-rotator sequence across several billion years imply an approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In particular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently toward longer periods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the ≈700 Myr Praesepe and the 1 Gyr {NGC} 6811 clusters, however, are not fully consistent with this general pattern. While the stars of 1 {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterM}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater⊙{\textbackslash}textlesssub/{\textbackslash}textgreater on the slow-rotator sequence of the older {NGC} 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger Praesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (≲0.8 {\textbackslash}textlessi{\textbackslash}{textgreaterM}{\textbackslash}textlessi/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlesssub{\textbackslash}textgreater⊙{\textbackslash}textlesssub/{\textbackslash}textgreater). In other words, it seems that low-mass stars have not been spinning down in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a manifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The resurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate for that lost at the surface due to wind braking. In our model the internal redistribution of angular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling occurs at different ages for stars of different masses. The semi-empirical mass dependence of the rotational coupling timescale included in our model produces an evolution of the slow-rotator sequence in very good agreement with the observations. Our model, in particular, explains the stalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and {NGC} 6811, and predicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other mass ranges.},

	abstract = {Rotational scaling relationships are examined for the degree of equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies in stellar convection zones. These scaling relationships are approached from two paradigms, with first a glance at scaling relationship built on an energy-balance argument and second a look at a force-based scaling. The latter implies a transition between a nearly constant inertial scaling when in the asymptotic limit of minimal diffusion and magnetostrophy, whereas the former implies a weaker scaling with convective Rossby number. Both scaling relationships are then compared to a suite of 3D convective dynamo simulations with a wide variety of domain geometries, stratifications, and range of convective Rossby numbers.},

	abstract = {Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly {\textbackslash}textasciitilde50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing {\textbackslash}textasciitilde100 to 300 seconds).},

It is found that the mean level of their Ca {II} H and K emission (averaged over 15 years) is correlated with rotation period, as expected. However, there is a further dependence of the emission on spectral type. When expressed as the ratio of chromospheric flux to total bolometric flux, the emission is well correlated with the parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo characteristics.},

One of these stars, the subgiant {KIC} 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived asteroseismic estimates of the properties of {KIC} 11026764 from Kepler photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of {KIC} 11026764 with a precision near 1\%, and an accuracy near 2\% for the radius and 15\% for the age.

In a group of stars with individual spectral types from G2 to K7, the cycle periods were consistent with the relation P(cyc) is approximately equal to (P rot/tauc) exp n, where tauc is the convective turnover time near the bottom of the convection zone. On the basis of the above relations, it is suggested that an increase of P(cyc) with increasing P(rot) does not agree with conventional estimates from nonlinear dynamo models, and is limited by two factors: the quenching of the alpha effect; and differential rotation.},

	abstract = {The correlation between stellar activity, as measured by the indicator {DRHK}, and the Rossby number Ro in late-type stars is revisited in light of recent developments in solar dynamo theory. Different stellar interior models, based on both mixing-length theory and the full spectrum of turbulence, are used in order to see to what extent the correlation of activity with Rossby number is model dependent, or otherwise can be considered universal. Although we find some modest model dependence, we find that the correlation of activity with Rossby number is significantly better than with rotation period alone for all the models we consider. Dynamo theory suggests that activity should scale with the dynamo number. A current model of the solar dynamo, the so-called interface dynamo, proposes that the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field by differential rotation (the v-effect) and the production of the poloidal magnetic field from toroidal by helical turbulence (the a-effect) take place in different, adjacent layers near the base of the convection zone. A new scale analysis based on the interface dynamo shows that the appropriate dynamo number does not depend on the Rossby number alone, but also depends on an additional dimensionless factor related to the differential rotation. This leads to a new interpretation of the correlation between activity and Rossby number, which in turn leads to some conclusions about the magnitude of differential rotation in the dynamo layers of late-type main-sequence stars.},

We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo “peak-bagging” approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}Δ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}ν and δ \{ν \}02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \{ν \}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmax with \{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashleq{\textbackslash}1 {\textbackslash}M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}). Unfortunately, rotation period {\textbackslash}(P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}){\textbackslash} measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto {\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm age\}{\textbackslash}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag{\textbackslash}textbackslash"ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}1.4-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia {DR}2 to identify likely single-star members of the \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}1-Gyr-old cluster {NGC} 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}0.8 to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox{\textbackslash}0.6 {\textbackslash}M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in {NGC} 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm{\textbackslash}0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, {NGC} 6811's color-{\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to {\textbackslash}T\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm eff\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 4295{\textbackslash} K (K5V, 0.7 {\textbackslash}M\_{\textbackslash}textbackslashodot{\textbackslash}), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where {\textbackslash}P\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm rot\}{\textbackslash} stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Broad and shallow absorption lines in stellar spectra are shown to be due to axial rotation. The evidence is based upon the following facts: (a) the broadening depends upon wave-length, as required by the Doppler principle; (b) in spectroscop'ic binaries there is a distinct correlation between line width on one side and period and amplitude on the other; and (c) as was shown by Elvey, the contours of "dish-shaped" lines agree well with the theoretical shapes of lines of rapidly rotating stars. A survey of the spectra of stars of various types shows that rapid rotation is peculiar to the earliest spectral classes. The B- and A-stars display the greatest tendency toward rapid rotation. In the F's the proportion of rapidly rotating stars is smaller, and in classes G, K, and M no cases of rapid rotation have been observed in single stars. The effect of rotation upon the contours of components of spectroscopic binaries is discussed. In a Virginis the stronger component is found to rotate with an equatorial velocity of 200 km/sec., while for the fainter component the rotational velocity is not more than about 50 km/sec. This indicates a marked difference in the size of the com- ponents. The ratio of the radii is roughly 4 to i. The contours of lines in i{\textbackslash}textasciitilde Ursae Majoris suggest an equatorial velocity of about 200 km/sec. This single star is thus similar to the stronger component of a Virginis. Both stars are found to be stable, but the characteristic quantity w2/27r{\textbackslash}textasciitildeyp is not far from the critical value where the Maclaurin ellipsoids of rotation lose stability. It is suggested that there is a transition between close s{\textbackslash}textasciitildeectroscopic binaries and rapidly rotating single -stars in the earliest spectral classes. Observations do not establish the direction in which this transition proceeds},

We are here concerned with the first of these, which is usually designated as `natural widening' of spectral lines. H. N. Russell and others have shown that this type of broadening is particularly important in the stars because of the large number of absorbing atoms present in a stellar reversing layer.

We aim at evaluating the impact of wind braking, realistic atmospheric treatment, rotation and rotation-induced mixing on the structural and rotational evolution from the pre-main sequence to the turn-off. Using the {STAREVOL} code, we provide an updated {PMS} grid. We compute stellar models for 7 different metallicities, from [Fe/H] = -1 dex to [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex with a solar composition corresponding to {\textbackslash}Z=0.0134{\textbackslash}. The initial stellar mass ranges from 0.2 to 1.5{\textbackslash}{textbackslashMs} with extra grid refinement around one solar mass. We also provide rotating models for three different initial rotation rates (slow, median and fast) with prescriptions for the wind braking and disc-coupling timescale calibrated on observed properties of young open clusters. The rotational mixing includes an up-to-date description of the turbulence anisotropy in stably stratified regions. The overall behaviour of our models at solar metallicity – and its constitutive physics – is validated through a detailed comparison with a variety of distributed evolutionary tracks. The main differences arise from the choice of surface boundary conditions and initial solar composition. The models including rotation with our prescription for angular momentum extraction and self-consistent formalism for angular momentum transport are able to reproduce the rotation period distribution observed in young open clusters over a broad mass-range. These models are publicly available and may be used to analyse data coming from present and forthcoming asteroseismic and spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, {TESS} and {PLATO}.},

The technique chosen for inverting the solar oscillation data was the discretized least-squares technique. The results indicate that the rotation rate of the sun in the equatorial plane declines going inward between the surface and 0.6 of the radius and that the polar rate increases going inward (i.e., the surfacelike differential rotation decreases with depth).},

The contours can be represented by an equation of the simple exponential type. The presence of the Stark effect is shown by the asymmetry of He 4388 and by the "forbidden" line X 4470 of helium in the violet wing of He 4472. "Dish-shaped" contours of the lines in the spectra of i6 X Aqi., 4 {\textbackslash}textasciitilde Cor., i{\textbackslash}textasciitilde q Tau., On., and 22 X Cep. indicate axial rotation of these stars. By Mime's theory, logarithms of the number of atoms responsible for producing an absorption line are computed for various assumptions of the physical properties of the stars. These are shown in the form of curves by plots of log N{\textbackslash}textasciitilde against the tempera- ture. The number of atoms {NHf} is determined for each star with use of Unsold's theory. To eliminate the Stark effect and the broadening due to rotation, {NHf} is determined by comparing the areas of the observed contours with those given by theory. A value of 0.1 was arbitrarily chosen forf, and the resulting numbers of atoms have been compared with the curves computed from Milne's theory. The observations support the assump- tion that the coefficient of absorption varies with the pressure, rather than that it is a constant. The observations indicate pressures of 783 dynes/cm2 to 9270 dynes/cm2 for g equal to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde cm/sec.,2 the temperatures being from 10,0000 to 30,000{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$.

This method can give the difference in sound speed and density between two solar models or between a solar model and the Sun using the corresponding frequency differences. Tests using pairs of known solar models show that this technique is capable of reproducing the sound speed to an accuracy of better than 0.1\% for r{\textbackslash}textless0.97Rsun\_ , while the density can be determined to an accuracy of better than 0.5\% in most of the radiative interior. Using the observed frequencies of solar oscillations it is found that the sound speed and density in a solar model with gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements is very close to that in the Sun, the maximum difference being 0.5\% for the sound speed and 1.5\% for density. It is possible to use this technique to obtain the adiabatic index \{{GAMMA}\}\_1\_ inside the Sun, which can be employed as a probe for the equation of state in stellar interiors. The relative sound speed difference between the reference solar model and the Sun just below the He ii ionization zone indicates that the adiabatic index of the solar material in this region is smaller than that in the model. The inverted density profile is found to be stable against convection in the solar core, while the depth of the surface convection zone is found to be approximately 0.29Rsun\_.},

We restrict our study to the case where the stars are submitted to a moderate wind which obeys Skumanich's (1972) spindown relation. Stellar models are computed with the new {OPAL} opacities, and adjustable stellar parameters are calibrated using the Sun. The results of our numerical simulations are precisely compared with lithium and beryllium abundances observed in seven galactic lusters.

We used the inversion method of multiplicative optimally localised averages to assess how well internal and surface rotation rates can be recovered from different mode sets and different synthetic rotation profiles. Results. We confirm that dipole mixed modes are sufficient to set constraints on the average core-rotation rates in red giants. However, surface-rotation rates estimated with only dipole mixed modes are contaminated by the core rotation. We show that the sensitivity to surface rotation decreases from the base of the red-giant branch until it reaches a minimum at 60–80\% of the bump luminosity due to a glitch in the buoyancy frequency. Thereafter, a narrow range of increased surface sensitivity just below the bump luminosity exists. Quadrupole and octopole modes have more sensitivity in the outer parts of the star. To obtain accurate estimates of rotation rates at intermediate radii (i.e. a fractional radius of ∼0.4), acoustic oscillation modes with a spherical degree of l ≈ 10 are needed. Conclusions. We find a minimum and subsequent maximum in the sensitivity to the surface rotation rate in red giants below the luminosity bump. Furthermore, we show that, if observed, quadrupole and octopole modes enable us to distinguish between differential and solid body rotation in the convection zone.

This instability may provide an important contribution to angular momentum transport in stars and planets. We adopt a local Boussinesq Cartesian shearing box model, which represents a small patch of a differentially rotating stellar radiation zone. Complementary simulations are also performed with stress-free, impenetrable boundaries in the local radial direction. The linear and nonlinear evolution of the equatorial axisymmetric instability is formally equivalent to the salt fingering instability. This is no longer the case in 3D, but we find that the instability behaves nonlinearly in a similar way to salt fingering. Axisymmetric simulations – and those in 3D with short dimensions along the local azimuthal direction – quickly develop strong jets along the rotation axis, which inhibit the instability and lead to predator-prey-like temporal dynamics. In 3D, the instability initially produces homogeneous turbulence and enhanced momentum transport, though in some cases jets form on a much longer timescale. We propose and validate numerically a simple theory for nonlinear saturation of the {GSF} instability and its resulting angular momentum transport. This theory is straightforward to implement in stellar evolution codes incorporating rotation. We estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute towards explaining the missing angular momentum transport required in red giant stars, and play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline.},

We find that transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismic observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical description of stars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles. For instance, we find that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability does not extract enough angular momentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase of the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to significantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. Conclusions. Our results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontal turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanism not included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow down the rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.},

We produced a homogeneous catalog of the frequency of maximum power (typical uncertainty \{σ \}\{ν {\textbackslash}textbackslashmax \}=1.6 \% ), the mean large frequency separation (\{σ \}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}Δ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}ν {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=0.6 \% ), oscillation amplitude (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}\{\{A\}\}=4.7 \% ), granulation power (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}gran{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=8.6 \% ), power excess width (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}width{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=8.8 \% ), seismically derived stellar mass (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}\{\{M\}\}=7.8 \% ), radius (\{σ \}\{\{R\}\}=2.9 \% ), and thus surface gravity (\{σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}logg\}=0.01 dex). Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch ({RGB}) and helium-core-burning ({HeB}) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed \{ν \}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmax , which might hold clues for understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as {APOGEE} and {LAMOST}.},

	abstract = {We continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke ({GSF}) instability in differentially rotating radiation zones. This instability may be a key player in transporting angular momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains mostly unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability, whereas here we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq model in a modified shearing box for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations with stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear instability and derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear evolution. The instability is found to behave very differently compared with its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the development of strong zonal jets ("layering" in the angular momentum), which can considerably enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations. The jets are, in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle that corresponds initially with that of the linear modes, but which evolves with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability transports angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it does at the equator, and we estimate that the {GSF} instability could contribute to the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters.},

Due to their high scientific value, in particular for Galaxy population studies and stellar structure and evolution, their Kepler light curves were made public in late 2011. More than 13,000 (over 85\%) of these stars show intrinsic flux variability caused by solar-like oscillations making them ideal for large-scale asteroseismic investigations. We automatically extracted individual frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipole modes in nearly every red giant. These measurements naturally classify the stars into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass (M/M ⊙ {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1.8) helium-core-burning red clump, and the higher-mass (M/M ⊙ {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1.8) secondary clump. The period spacings also reveal that a large fraction of the stars show rotationally induced frequency splittings. This sample of stars will undoubtedly provide an extremely valuable source for studying the stellar population in the direction of the Kepler field, in particular when combined with complementary spectroscopic surveys.},

We computed stellar evolution models with rotation and model the transport of angular momentum by the action of a sole dominant diffusive process parameterised by an additional viscosity in the equation of angular momentum transport. We constrained the values of this viscosity to match the mean core rotation rates of red giants and their behaviour with mass and evolution using asteroseismic indicators along the red giant branch and in the red clump. Results. For red giants in the hydrogen-shell burning phase, the transport of angular momentum must be more efficient in more massive stars. The additional viscosity is found to vary by approximately two orders of magnitude in the mass range M ∼ 1–2.5 M . As stars evolve along the red giant branch, the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum must increase for low-mass stars (M 2 M ) and remain approximately constant for slightly higher masses (2.0 M M 2.5 M ). In red clump stars, the additional viscosities must be an order of magnitude higher than in younger red giants of similar mass during the hydrogen-shell burning phase. Conclusions. In combination with previous efforts, we obtain a clear picture of how the physical processes acting in stellar interiors should redistribute angular momentum from the end of the main sequence until the core-helium burning phase for low- and intermediate-mass stars to satisfy the asteroseismic constraints.},

Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of ∼2\% in radius, ∼4\% in mass, and ∼10\% in age, making this the best-characterized sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences from chemical enrichment laws ΔY/ΔZ and predictions from 3D atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements, Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs {LEGACY} sample, these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic properties available for at least another decade.

By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power (νmax) and the large frequency separation (Δν). We find excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 4\%. We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean deviations for stars between T eff = 4600-6200 K of -22 {\textbackslash}pm 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 {\textbackslash}pm 31 K (with a scatter of 93 K), respectively.

We investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the physical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods. We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant {KIC} 8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of {KIC} 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results. We find that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant {KIC} 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity νadd corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be νadd = 3 × 104 cm2 s−1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.},

Mosser et al. (2012) have measured the rotation rates in the central regions of intermediate-mass core helium burning stars (secondary clump stars). Our aim was to exploit\& the rotational splittings of mixed modes to estimate the amount of radial differential rotation in the interior of secondary clump stars using Kepler data, in order to place constraints on angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars. We selected a subsample of Kepler secondary clump stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By applying a thorough statistical analysis, we showed that the splittings of both gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and p-dominated modes (trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then used these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al. 2013). We obtained evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating {\textbackslash}1.8{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm0.3{\textbackslash} to {\textbackslash}3.2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm1.0{\textbackslash} times faster than the envelope. The last target was found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. This demonstrates that an efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the short-lived subgiant phase, or once He-burning has started in the core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.},

The space-based photometry reveals pulsation properties previously inaccessible to ground-based observations. We observe a sharp dichotomy in oscillation mode line widths at roughly 800 s, such that white dwarf pulsations with periods exceeding 800 s have substantially broader mode line widths, more reminiscent of a damped harmonic oscillator than a heat-driven pulsator. Extended Kepler coverage also permits extensive mode identification: we identify the spherical degree of 87 out of 201 unique radial orders, providing direct constraints of the rotation period for 20 of these 27 {DAVs}, more than doubling the number of white dwarfs with rotation periods determined via asteroseismology. We also obtain spectroscopy from 4 m-class telescopes for all {DAVs} with Kepler photometry. Using these homogeneously analyzed spectra, we estimate the overall mass of all 27 {DAVs}, which allows us to measure white dwarf rotation as a function of mass, constraining the endpoints of angular momentum in low- and intermediate-mass stars. We find that 0.51–0.73 M⊙ white dwarfs, which evolved from 1.7–3.0 M⊙ {ZAMS} progenitors, have a mean rotation period of 35 hr with a standard deviation of 28 hr, with notable exceptions for higher-mass white dwarfs.

	abstract = {We compare the first direct angular diameter measurements obtained on our closest stellar neighbour, alpha Centauri, to recent model diameters constrained by asteroseismic observations. Using the {VINCI} instrument installed at {ESO}'s {VLT} Interferometer ({VLTI}), the angular diameters of the two main components of the system, alpha Cen A and B, were measured with a relative precision of 0.2\% and 0.6\% respectively. Particular care has been taken in the calibration of these measurements, considering that {VINCI} is estimating the fringe visibility using a broadband K filter. We obtain uniform disk angular diameters for alpha Cen A and B of {thetaUD} [A] = 8.314 +/- 0.016 mas and {thetaUD} [B] = 5.856 +/- 0.027 mas, and limb darkened angular diameters of {thetaLD} [A] = 8.511 +/- 0.020 mas and {thetaLD} [B] = 6.001 +/- 0.034 mas. Combining these values with the parallax from Söderhjelm ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{soderhjelm\}), we derive linear diameters of D[A] = 1.224 +/- 0.003 Dsun and D[B] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 Dsun. These values are compatible with the masses published by Thévenin et al. ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{thevenin02\}) for both stars.},

For ideal fluids, Chandrasekhar had shown the stability of this configuration if the Alfvén velocity of the field equals the velocity of the background flow, i.e., if the magnetic Mach number . We demonstrate that magnetized Taylor–Couette flows with such profiles become unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations if at least one of the diffusivities is finite. We also find that for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the lines of marginal instability scale with the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. In the limit the lines of marginal instability completely lie below the line for and for they completely lie above this line. For any finite value of , however, the lines of marginal instability cross the line , which separates slow from fast rotation. The minimum values of the field strength and the rotation rate that are needed for the instability (slightly) grow if the rotation law becomes flat. In this case, the electric current of the background field becomes so strong that the current-driven Tayler instability (which also exists without rotation) appears in the bifurcation map at low Hartmann numbers.},

We show that while the fundamental stellar parameters do not depend on the treatment of convection adopted (Mixing Length Theory - {MLT} - or “Full Spectrum of Turbulence” - {FST}), the age of the system depends on the inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the small frequency separation of component B. We try to answer the question of the universality of the mixing length parameter, and we find a statistically reliable dependence of the α-parameter on the {HR} diagram location (with a trend similar to the predictions based on 2-D simulations). We propose the frequency separation ratios as better observables to determine the fundamental stellar parameters, and to use the large frequency separation and frequencies to extract information about the stellar structure. The effects of diffusion and equation of state on the oscillation frequencies are also studied, but present seismic data do not allow their determination.},

For the very steep rotation law {\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto Rˆ\{-2\} (the Rayleigh limit) and for small Pm the threshold values of rotation and field for this Azimuthal {MagnetoRotational} Instability ({AMRI}) scale with the ordinary Reynolds number and the Hartmann number, resp.

For fluids with more flat rotation laws the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number are no longer typical quantities for the instability. For the weakly nonlinear system the numerical values of the kinetic energy and the magnetic energy are derived for magnetic Prandtl numbers {\textbackslash}textbackslashleq 1. We find that the magnetic energy grows monotonically with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, while the kinetic energy grows with Rm/{\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt\{Pm\}. The resulting turbulent Schmidt number, as the ratio of the `eddy' viscosity and the diffusion coefficient of a passive scalar (such as lithium) is of order 20 for Pm=1, but for small Pm it drops to order unity. Hence, in a stellar core with fossil fields and steep rotation law the transport of angular momentum by {AMRI} is always accompanied by an intense mixing of the plasma, until the rotation becomes rigid.},

Here, we present the analysis of data from 10 days observing run carried out in November 1998. We detect significant excess in the power between 0.5-1.5 {mHz} in the periodograms of the time series of mean Doppler shifts. Observations of eta Cas made with the same instrument during the same time interval and in almost identical night conditions show a flat spectrum in this frequency range, indicating that the excess of Doppler signal seen on Procyon is of stellar origin. When data from the whole run are jointly analyzed, a period analysis places an upper limit of 0.50-0.60 ms-1 for the amplitude of oscillations, while the frequency cutoff is around 1.5 {mHz}. The power evidently drops near 0.55 and 1.5 {mHz} on the average of unfiltered power spectra of individual nights, which is consistent with the expected p-mode oscillation properties for Procyon. Several equispaced peaks in frequency are recurrent in the power spectra of two independent segments of 4 and 3 contiguous nights; the most probable frequency spacing seems to be 55 mu Hz. In conclusion, we now have an instrument set-up which is sufficiently stable and fast to be used for a multi-site campaign involving instruments with comparable velocity precisions, to detect the oscillation modes of sun-like stars.

One fringe at a selected path difference of the interferogram produced by the flux of a star through a bandpass chosen in the near infrared is continuously scanned. Its phase is measured and translated directly into velocity with an absolute calibration, providing a sensitive measurement of the Doppler signal. This paper reports the 4.5 nights observation of Procyon in February 1998 with this instrumentation. The final 1-sigma noise of the spectrum beyond 0.8 {mHz} is as low as 0.12 m s(-1{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}.{muHz} (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}-1/2)) . Even with this noise level, in a single site observation we cannot report a firm detection of p-modes. We do not detect any significant excess in the power spectrum near 1 {mHz}. A limit on the amplitude of the modes can be deduced, which cannot exceed 1 m s(-1) . However, the “comb response” exhibits the signature of a possible regular pattern with a large splitting nu\_0 of 53 mu Hz, which would indicate that a signal of stellar origin has been detected. Both values agree with theoretical predictions, but are in contradiction with claimed detection of p-modes previously reported.},

We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]{\textbackslash}textless-2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities.},

Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation, indicating that the variations seen on Procyon are of stellar origin. The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well.

Our knowledge and understanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in the data.

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \& Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars (“shellular rotation law”, cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied.},

	abstract = {For this invited contribution, I was asked to give an overview about the application of helio and aster-oseismic techniques to study the interior of giant planets, and to specifically present the recent observations of Neptune by Kepler K2. Seismology applied to giant planets could drastically change our understanding of their deep interiors, as it has happened with the Earth, the Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved stars. The study of giant planets' composition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their formation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own. Unfortunately, its determination is complicated by the fact that their interior is thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a whole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely on indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid and convective, which makes their seismology much closer to that of solar-like stars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology techniques naturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can be used: photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and ring seismology in the specific case of Saturn. The current decade has been promising thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic oscillations with the ground-based imaging-spectrometer {SYMPA} and indirect detection of Saturn's f-modes in its rings by the {NASA} Cassini orbiter. This has motivated new projects of ground-based and space-borne instruments that are under development. The K2 observations represented the first opportunity to search for planetary oscillations with visible photometry. Despite the excellent quality of K2 data, the noise level of the power spectrum of the light curve was not low enough to detect Neptune's oscillations. The main results from the K2 observations are the clear detection of the well-known differential rotation of Neptune, measured for the first time through the rotational modulation of its photometry, and the detection of the Sun's oscillations, for the first time in an indirect way in intensity measurements.},

Until now, laws of the form T\_eff {\textbackslash}textbackslashpropto g\_effˆ\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashbeta\} have been used, but they are only valid for slowly rotating stars. We propose a simple model that can describe the latitudinal variations in the flux of rotating stars at any rotation rate. This model assumes that the energy flux is a divergence-free vector that is antiparallel to the effective gravity. When mass distribution can be described by a Roche model, the latitudinal variations in the effective temperature only depend on a single parameter, namely the ratio of the equatorial velocity to the Keplerian velocity. We validate this model by comparing its predictions to those of the most realistic two-dimensional models of rotating stars issued from the {ESTER} code. The agreement is very good, as it is with the observations of two rapidly rotating stars, \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\} Aql and \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashalpha\} Leo. We suggest that as long as a gray atmosphere can be accepted, the inversion of data on flux distribution coming from interferometric observations of rotating stars uses such a model, which has just one free parameter.},

One science goal that makes optimal use of K2's capabilities, in particular its 360{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$ ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology—the study of the evolution of the Galaxy from the fossil stellar record. The thrust of this research is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from K2 in order to detect oscillations in red giant stars. This asteroseismic information can provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass, and age of vast numbers of stars across the Galaxy. Here we present the initial analysis of a subset of red giants, observed toward the north galactic gap, during the mission's first full science campaign. We investigate the feasibility of using K2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparent magnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). We demonstrate that oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the \{log\}g range ∼1.9-3.2. Our detection is complete down to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{Kp\}\} ∼ 14.5, which results in a seismic sample with little or no detection bias. This sample is ideally suited to stellar population studies that seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary Galaxy models.},

Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core. Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime, which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than 300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex.

	abstract = {The {GONG} and {MDI} global helioseismology pipelines provide solar acoustic mode parameters for 108- and 72-day time series respectively by fitting the 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m spectra of a given (n, ℓ/) multiplet either individually ({GONG}) or simultaneously ({MDI}). Our knowledge of the variable solar interior through helioseismic observations derives primarily from these two analysis pipelines. We have developed a new method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting the rotation- and structure-induced frequency shift for each m-spectrum to minimize the mode width in the m-averaged spectrum. The m-averaged spectrum appears to be a powerful tool for low signal-to-noise-ratio modes in the low-frequency range where the modes have very long lifetimes. Indeed, in the case of spatially-resolved helioseismic data ({MDI}, {GONG}, {HMI}), for a given multiplet (n, ℓ/), there exist 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m spectra, which can result in an average spectrum with a {SNR} ≫ 1 even when the individual-m spectra have a {SNR} {\textbackslash}textless 1. We show here that the m-averaged spectrum technique, applied to the {GONG} 108-day and {MDI} 72-day time series, gives us access to a whole new range of predicted, low-{SNR} modes that had not been successfully fitted by the current {MDI} and {GONG} peak-fitting pipelines. We show that the modes that are measured by both techniques are extracted without bias. We apply this technique to 360-, 720-, 1080-, and 1440-day long {GONG} time series to infer the variability of the mode parameters with solar activity in the low-frequency range below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1500 μHz.},

The calculations indicate that ignoring the finite time scales associated with angular-momentum redistribution is a poor and often misleading approximation. The primary results are: (1) evolved stellar cores develop nonaxisymmetric instabilities corresponding to the bifurcation of the Maclaurin sequence before they reach critical (Keplerian) rotational velocities; (2) for the 7-solar-mass star, the instability point is reached prior to carbon ignition, indicating that catastrophic carbon detonation may be avoided by rotating stars; and (3) the hydrodynamic events associated with violent stellar death will generally involve rapidly rotating, triaxial, or fissioning cores. In addition to radically altering the nature of these events, this indicates that stellar collapse may be a strong source of gravitational-wave radiation.},

	abstract = {The {GOLF} experiment on the {SOHO} mission aims to study the internal structure of the Sun by measuring the spectrum of global oscillations in the frequency range 10-7 to 10-2 Hz. Here we present the results of the analysis of the first 8 months of data. Special emphasis is put into the frequency determination of the p modes, as well as the splitting in the multiplets due to rotation. For both, we show that the improvement in S/N level with respect to the ground-based networks and other experiments is essential in achieving a very low-degree frequency table with small errors ∼ 2 parts in 10-5). On the other hand, the splitting found seems to favour a solar core which does not rotate slower than its surface. The line widths do agree with theoretical expectations and other observations.},

After introducing some basic helioseismic concepts, it covers, in turn, the rotation of the core and radiative interior, the "tachocline" shear layer at the base of the convection zone, the differential rotation in the convection zone, the near-surface shear, the pattern of migrating zonal flows known as the torsional oscillation, and the possible temporal variations at the bottom of the convection zone. For each area, the article also briefly explores the relationship between observations and models.},

The initial performance of {GOLF} is shown to be within the design specification, for the entire instrument as well as for the separate sub-systems. Malfunctioning of the polarising mechanisms after 3 to 4 months operation has led to the adoption of an unplanned operating sequence in which these mechanisms are no longer used. This mode, which measures only the blue wing of the solar sodium lines, detracts little from the detection and frequency measurements of global oscillations, but does make more difficult the absolute velocity calibration, which is currently of the order of 20\%. Data continuity in the new mode is extremely high and the instrument is producing exceptionally noise-free p-mode spectra. The data set is particularly well suited to the study of effects due to the excitation mechanism of the modes, leading to temporal variations in their amplitudes. The g modes have not yet been detected in this limited data set. In the present mode of operation, there are no indications of any degradation which would limit the use of {GOLF} for up to 6 years or more.},

	abstract = {Context. We still do not understand which physical mechanisms are responsible for the transport of angular momentum inside stars. The recent detection of mixed modes that contain the clear signature of rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and red giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this question. Aims: Our aim is to probe the radial dependence of the rotation profiles for a sample of Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants are particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are more sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case for their more evolved counterparts. Methods: We first extracted the rotational splittings and frequencies of the modes for six young Kepler red giants. We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted the internal rotation profiles of the six stars. Results: We obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that contract from those that expand. Conclusions: We characterized the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant branches.

The source of this systematic difference may be due to an asymmetry effect that is stronger for modes seen in intensity. Wavelet analysis is also used to compare the shape of the forcing functions.

The average space velocity of their progenitor stars is less than 15kms-1, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial `kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1,000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. The specific physical process that `kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, but unless its force is exerted exactly head-on it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks may cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2s, and never become radio pulsars.},

	abstract = {The Solar Oscillations Investigation ({SOI}) uses the Michelson Doppler Imager ({MDI}) instrument to probe the interior of the Sun by measuring the photospheric manifestations of solar oscillations. Characteristics of the modes reveal the static and dynamic properties of the convection zone and core. Knowledge of these properties will improve our understanding of the solar cycle and of stellar evolution. Other photospheric observations will contribute to our knowledge of the solar magnetic field and surface motions. The investigation consists of coordinated efforts by several teams pursuing specific scientific objectives. The instrument images the Sun on a 10242 {CCD} camera through a series of increasingly narrow spectral filters. The final elements, a pair of tunable Michelson interferometers, enable {MDI} to record filtergrams with a {FWHM} bandwidth of 94 {mÅ}. Normally 20 images centered at 5 wavelengths near the Ni I 6768 spectral line are recorded each minute. {MDI} calculates velocity and continuum intensity from the filtergrams with a resolution of 4″ over the whole disk. An extensive calibration program has verified the end-to-end performance of the instrument. To provide continuous observations of the longest-lived modes that reveal the internal structure of the Sun, a carefully-selected set of spatial averages are computed and downlinked at all times. About half the time {MDI} will also be able to downlink complete velocity and intensity images each minute. This high rate telemetry ({HRT}) coverage is available for at least a continuous 60-day interval each year and for 8 hours each day during the rest of the year. During the 8-hour {HRT} intervals, 10 of the exposures each minute can be programmed for other observations, such as measurements in {MDI}'s higher resolution (1.25″) field centered about 160″ north of the equator; meanwhile, the continuous structure program proceeds during the other half minute. Several times each day, polarizers will be inserted to measure the line-of-sight magnetic field. {MDI} operations will be scheduled well in advance and will vary only during the daily 8-hour campaigns. Quick-look and summary data, including magnetograms, will be processed immediately. Most high-rate data will be delivered only by mail to the {SOI} Science Support Center ({SSSC}) at Stanford, where a processing pipeline will produce 3 Terabytes of calibrated data products each year. These data products will be analyzed using the {SSSC} and the distributed resources of the co-investigators. The data will be available for collaborative investigations.},

The nearly uniform rotation of the core of the Sun is evidence for the existence of such fields.

Small random non-axisymmetries ( {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 10(-3) ) in the mass loss process, on the other hand, add sufficient angular momentum to explain the observed rotation periods around one day. The process illustrated with a computation of the probability distribution of the rotation periods under the combined influence of random forcing by weak nonaxisymmetries and angular momentum loss in the {AGB} superwind.

	abstract = {{SOHO} will carry twelve sophisticated telescopes and other instruments, developed in record time by twelve international consortia involving scientific institutes in 15 countries. Roger M. Bonnet, the Director of {ESA}'s Scientific Programme said: "Each one of these instruments by itself would be enough to make major breakthroughs in our understanding of the Sun. But what makes {SOHO} such an exciting mission is that we will operate all the instruments together and find possible links between various phenomena at different levels in the volume of the Sun and in the interplanetary medium". Four years of intense efforts by space engineering teams in {ESA} and across Europe, under the leadership of the prime contractor Matra Marconi Space of Toulouse, France, have fulflled the dream of scientists who wished to build a superb space observatory for examining the Sun. {SOHO}, together with the four-spacecraft Cluster mission - which will explore near-Earth space, forms the Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme, the first cornerstone in {ESA}'s long-term programme 'Horizon 2000'. No night time for {SOHO} Instead of being placed in orbit around the Earth, {SOHO} will be lofted to a position where the gravitational pulls of the Earth and the Sun cancel each other out exactly, at 1.5 million kilometres sunward from the Earth. This is known in astronomy as the inner Lagrangian point after the French mathematician, Joseph Louis Lagrange, who first calculated its position near the end of the eighteenth century. {SOHO} will fly in an elliptical, or "halo" orbit around the Lagrangian point, with an orbit radius of about 600,000 kilometres, allowing the spacecraft to experience perpetual day. It will have a continuous, uninterrupted view of the Sun for twenty four hours of the day, all three hundred and sixty five days of the year, producing an extraordinary amount of data. All previous solar observatories have either been on the Earth or in orbit around our planet. On the Earth, telescopes are limited by inclement weather conditions and atmospheric distortion of the Sun's signal, and of course they cannot observe the Sun at night. Although the weather problem has been removed in orbit around the Earth, observations are still periodically interrupted when an Earth-orbiting spacecraft enters our planet's shadow. In contrast, {SOHO} will provide the first long, clean uninterrupted views of the Sun. Science Objectives {SOHO} will look beyond the visible soar disk, observing through new windows from the centre of the Sun to the Earth. It will examine three regions - the hidden interior of the Sun, the hot transparent solar atmosphere, and the eternal solar wind of charged particles and magnetic fields that continuously flow outward from the Sun. The twelve instruments on board {SOHO} are designed to study one or two of these regions in a different, yet complimentary way. Their combined data will link events in the Sun's atmosphere and solar wind changes taking place deep within the Sun. The {SOHO} mission has three principle scientific objectives: 1. Study of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior 2. Study of the heating mechanisms of the Sun's million-degree atmosphere, or solar corona 3. Investigation of the solar wind, its origin and its acceleration processes. "Never before have solar physicists had the opportunity to work with such a comprehensive observatory giving them access literally to the whole Sun", said Martin C. E. Huber, the Head of {ESA}'s Space Science Department. Taking the pulse of the Sun {SOHO} wil illuminate the unseen depths of the Sun by recording widespread throbbing motions of the Sun's visible "surface", or photosphere. These oscillations are caused by sounds that are trapped inside the Sun. On striking the surface and rebounding back down, the sound waves cause the gases there to move up and down. Sound waves that penetrate deep within the Sun produce global surface oscillations with longer periods of up to a few hours; smaller, shorter oscillations refer to shallower layers. By considering a sequence of oscillations with longer and longer periods, describing sound waves that penetrate deeper and deeper, {SOHO} will 'peel away' progressively distant layers of the Sun and establish physical properties inside the Sun's deep interior. Since the technique is similar in scientific principle to using earthquakes, or seismic waves, to decipher the Earth's internal structure, it has become known as helioseismology. {SOHO}'s helioseismology data may shed light on solar neutrinos; they are insubstantial, subatomic particles created in prodigious quantities inside the Sun's energy-generating core. Neutrinos move at the velocity of light and travel almost unimpeded through the Sun, the Earth and nearly any amount of matter. The difficulty is that underground detectors always observe fewer neutrinos than theory says they should detect, a discrepancy known as the solar neutrino problem. Either the Sun does not shine the way we think it ought to, or our basic understanding of neutrinos is in error. {SOHO}'s record of surface oscillations may establish the temperature at the centre of the Sun, and tell us if there is something wrong with our knowledge of the way stars shine. If the centre of the Sun is about a million degrees cooler than is presently thought, nuclear reactions would produce fewer neutrinos and resolve the solar neutrino problem. But if the internal temperature has the expected value, then the neutrinos may have an identity crisis, undergoing metamorphosis before reaching terrestrial detectors that therefore cannot see them. Future {SOHO} helioseismology observations will also improve our understanding of the solar dynamo responsible for the Sun's magnetic field. The dynamo is located somewhere in the solar interior where the hot, rotating material generates electrical currents and converts the energy of motion into magnetic energy. Magnetic fields, spawned by the dynamo inside the Sun, thread their way out into the solar atmosphere where they mould the electrified gas into an ever-changing shape. The entire atmosphere is continuously transformed by the Sun's varying magnetism, producing activity on a scale unknown on Earth. Looking inside the Sun There are three helioseismology experts on board {SOHO} that will acquire long uninterrupted observations of solar oscillations. Two of them emphasise global, long-period oscillations and sound waves that can penetrate the deep solar interior. They are known as {GOLF}, for Global Oscillations at Low Frequency, and {VIRGO}, an acronym for Variability of solar {IRradiance} and Gravity Oscillations. The third {SOHO} helioseismology instrument will obtain data for oscillations on smaller spatial scales with unprecedented precision; it is called the Solar Oscillations Investigation/Michelson Doppler Imager, or {SOI}/{MDI} for short. {GOLF} and {MDI} employ the familiar Doppler technique for measuring motions of the solar photosphere. When part of the visible surface heaves up towards us, the wavelength of a spectral line formed in that region is shortened; if the region moves away from us, back toward the solar interior, the wavelength is lengthened. (A spectral line absorbed or emitted by an atom or an ion at a specific wavelength that identifies the element; it looks like a line in a spectral display of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength). Sound waves can also be used to determine the internal rotation of the Sun. Waves propagating in the direction of rotation will appear, to a fixed observer, to move faster and their measure speeds will be shorter. Waves propagating against the rotation will be slowed down with longer periods. Accurate measurements of this oscillation period splitting will determine rotation within the solar interior. {GOLF} aims to measure velocities as low as 1 millimetre per second for global surface oscillations with periods from 3 minutes to 100 days. {SOI}/{MDI} will obtain precise oscillation data with high spatial resolution, investigating surface oscillations of relatively small spatial scales and short periods. Both instruments will determine the radial distribution of density, pressure and temperature, establish the depth and latitude variation of rotation, and determine interior conditions that lead to the development of solar magnetic activity. {VIRGO} will measure variations in the Sun's irradiance, or its total luminous output, with extremely accurate, precise and stable radiometers. As the Sun fades and brightens, {VIRGO} will obtain a sensitive record of global, long-period oscillations, refining our knowledge of the physical and dynamic properties of the deep solar interior. The precise, long-duration measurements from {GOLF} and {VIRGO} may also lead to the unambiguous detection of solar waves for the first time. They are largely confined to the Sun's energy-generating core, and the force of gravity determines how quickly they rise and fall, much like waves in the ocean. Gravity waves that manage to reach the visible solar surface are expected to have long periods of an hour or more and to reveal conditions at the very centre of the Sun. They will shed new light on the solar neutrino problem and determine if the Sun's rotation speed increase near its centre. The Solar Atmosphere The entire Sun is just a huge, gaseous sphere that is compressed at its centre and becomes tenuous further out. So, the sharp visible edge of the Sun is an illusion. It is enveloped by gases that are so rarefied that we can see right through them, just as we see through the Earth's transparent air. This tenuous outer part of the Sun is therefore called the solar atmosphere. The lowest, densest level of the Sun's atmosphere is the photosphere, which simply means the sphere from which visible light comes - from the Greek photos for light. Just above the photosphere lies a thin layer called the chromosphere, from chromos, the Greek work for colour. Still higher, above the chromosphere, is the corona, or crown; this outermost layer of the solar atmosphere extends to the planets and beyond. The solar corona is extremely hot, with a temperature of a few million degrees. Its very existence is one of the most fundamental, unresolved paradoxes of modern solar physics. The photosphere is closer to the Sun's centre than the corona, but it is several hundred times cooler. Heat should not flow outward from a cooler to a hotter region; it violates common sense and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite more than a half century of investigation, the exact mechanism for heating corona still remains a mystery, and it is one of the main scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission. Sunlight passes right through the corona without depositing substantial quantities of energy in it. So, radiation cannot resolve the heating problem. Possible mechanisms involve the kinetic energy of moving material and/or magnetic energy. Unlike radiation, both of these forms of energy can flow from cold to hot regions. In and out motions within the solar interior within the solar interior generate sound waves that could accelerate into supersonic shocks; they apparently dissipate energy and generate heat in the lower chromosphere. However, observations suggest that sound waves cannot significantly heat the corona since they cannot reach that far. {SOHO} will test this conclusion, looking for the varying spectral signatures of sound waves in the chromosphere and corona. Magnetic energy should play a role in coronal heating. Magnetic fields shape the highly structured corona, and the brightest coronal structures are located where the magnetic field is the strongest. {SOHO}'s spectral instruments will therefore also look for the oscillating intensity and velocity signatures of magnetic waves that are produced by changing magnetism. Magnetic energy can also be converted into heat by numerous small, localised explosive events that have already been observed with space-borne telescopes at ultraviolet wavelengths. {SOHO} will provide new insight to the frequency, locations and power of such explosions. {SOHO} tunes in the Sun's atmosphere The solar atmosphere will be studied by five {SOHO} instruments. Three of them will study the chromosphere and the transition region in the low corona. They are known as {SUMER} for Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation, {CDS}, an acronym for Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer, and {EIT}, which is short for Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope. Two {SOHO} instruments will examine the middle corona between 1.1 and 10 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre. They are known as {UVCS} for {UltraViolet} Coronagraph Spectrometer and {LASCO}, an acronym for Large Angle and Spectrometric {COronagraph}. Four of these instruments detect invisible radiation at ultraviolet ({UV}) or extreme ultraviolet ({EUV}) wavelengths. {UV} light has wavelengths somewhat less that those of visible light, and waves of {EUV} are a little shorter than the {UV} ones. Since this radiation is partially or totally absorbed in our air, it must be observe using telescopes that have been lofted above the Earth's obscuring atmosphere in satellites such as {SOHO}. We can tune into different parts of the solar atmosphere by isolating {UV} or {EUV} radiation at just one wavelength and forming an image there. Certain {UV} and {EUV} lines act like thermometers, specifying the temperature when they are formed, while others are sensitive to the local density. Velocities of moving material can also be inferred from wavelength shifts or broadening of the lines. Temperature, density, and velocity measurements from all four experiments will be used to specify heating, flows and wave motions in different magnetic structures and at various levels in the solar atmosphere. When combined, they will uniquely describe an unseen world of violent change, extreme temperatures and powerful explosion, quite unlike the bland white-light face of the Sun. {SUMER}, {CDS} and {EIT} will observe lines over a temperature range of 10,000 to a few million degrees, and determine velocities down to 1 kilometre per second. {SUMER} and {CSA} will obtain images of the chromosphere and corona with high spatial and temporal resolution (down to 1 second of arc and as brief as 1 second) with a field view of about 4 minutes of arc; {EIT} will provide full disk images with coarser resolution. {UVCS} is an occulted telescope equipped to measure {UV} line intensities and profiles, determining physical parameters of the solar corona from 1.2 to 10 solar radii from Sun-centre with an angular resolution down to 12 seconds of arc. The remaining {SOHO} atmosphere instrument, {LASCO}, uses an occulting disk to mask the Sun's photosphere and view the dim visible sunlight scattered by free coronal electrons. (At a million degrees, several electrons are set free from each atom, leaving an ion behind.) Since the sky's light confuses such images, the finest detail is obtained from space where the daytime sky is truly and starkly black. The {LASCO} instrument contains three such coronagraphs with nested and overlapping annular fields of view from 1.1 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre, looking closer to, and further from, the Sun than all previous space-borne coronagraphs. The coronagraph images will provide electron densities, or the number of electrons per unit volume, specifying their global distribution and radial variation. The inner coronagraph will also permit high-resolution imaging spectroscopy from 1.1 to 3 solar radii. It will measure the intensities and wavelength (Doppler) shifts of visible lines emitted by coronal ions, determining temperature, density and velocity information that will also be used to understand the currently-unknown mechanism for heating the Sun's corona. The Solar Wind The hot solar atmosphere, or corona, is expanding into interplanetary space, filling the solar system with a perpetual flow of electrified matter called the solar wind. Unlike any wind on Earth, the solar wind is a rarefied mixture of protons, electrons and magnetic fields, streaming radially outward from the Sun. Thus, the space between the planets is not completely empty, it is filled with charged pieces of the Sun. At increasing distances from the Sun, where the solar gravity weakens, the hot coronal material creates an outward pressure that overcomes the Sun's gravity, creating a wind that accelerates away to supersonic speeds, like water overflowing a dam. And as the corona disperses, it must be replaced by gases welling up from below to feed the eternal solar wind. Spacecraft have made in situ (Latin for in original place", or literally, "in the same place") measurements of the solar wind near the Earth, showing that it manifests itself in two ways, either as wind moving at a relatively slow speed of 300 to 400 kilometres per second, or as high-speed streams of 600 to 800 kilometres per second. What forces propel the solar wind to these supersonic velocities with such tremendous energy, and where do the components of the solar wind come from? The acceleration and origin of the solar wind are not completely known, and are included as principal scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission. Given the high observed temperatures, the ordinary slow-speed wind is a consequence of its expected outward flow. As this component breaks away from the Sun, it will gain speed with distance, reaching supersonic speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second at a few solar radii from Sun-centre. So, the basic mystery for the acceleration of the slow-speed component is the unknown heat source of the corona. No one really knows how the high-speed stream is accelerated. And where does the solar wind come from? The high-speed component of the solar wind apparently squirts out of extended regions of low density and temperature in the solar corona. These regions, called coronal holes, appear as large dark areas in {EUV} or X-ray images, seemingly devoid of radiation. The magnetism in the coronal holes stretches radially outward, providing a fast lane for the high-speed wind. However, the source of the low-speed wind remains a mystery to be solved by future {SOHO} observations. {SOHO}: from the Sun to the Earth Coronal remote sensing and in-situ experiments on board {SOHO} will provide a comprehensive data set to study the solar wind from its source at the Sun to the Earth. We have already discussed two of them, {UVCS} and {LASCO}, that will determine temperature, density and velocity information in regions near the Sun where the solar wind is accelerated and has its origin (see previous section; {SOHO} Tunes in the Sun's Atmosphere). Three {SOHO} instruments, {CELIAS}, {COSTEP} and {ERNE}, will analyse in situ that charged particles in the solar wind. The Charge, {ELement} and Isotope Analysis System, or {CELIAS}, will measure the mass, ionic charge and energy of the low-speed and high-speed solar wind, as well as energetic particles emitted during explosions on the Sun. {COSTEP} ({COmprehensive} {SupraThermal} and Energetic Particle analyser) and {ERNE} (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron experiment) , together form a collaboration to study the energy release and particle acceleration processes in the solar atmosphere, as well as particle propagation in the interplanetary medium. {COSTEP} will measure energy spectra of electrons (up to 5 {MeV}), protons and helium nuclei (up to 52 {MeV}/nucleus). {ERNE} will measure energy spectra of heavier ions (up to 540 {MeV}/nucleus), abundance rations of isotopes and the anisotropy of the particle flux. The Study of Solar Wind {ANisotropies}, or {SWAN}, will make complete sky maps of the hydrogen density in the solar wind, determining the distribution of the solar wind mass flux from equator to pole as well as the variation of this distribution. Command and control of {SOHO} {ESA} has overall responsibility for the {SOHO} mission, but {NASA} will provide the launch, tracking and control. The spacecraft will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida by Atlas {IIAS}, the most powerful of the Atlas-Centaur rockets. The satellite will maintain contact with the ground through {NASA}'s Deep Space Network ({DSN}). The {DSN} is a network of three radio antennas spread around the world. One is in Goldstone, {USA}, a second near Madrid, Spain, and a third is placed in Canberra, Australia. Together, these antennas provide continuous links to spacecraft wherever thy happen to be in relation to Earth. After the {DSN} has collected the {SOHO} data, it will be routed to {NASA}'s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, {USA}, from where {SOHO} will be commanded. A special facility, known as the {SOHO} Experiment Operations Facility, has been set up at Goddard.. This will serve as the fulcrum for all {SOHO} operation. Scientists will meet there in order to use the spacecraft and to plan the scientific investigations it will be carrying out. The data from all observations will be stored there in an archive and researchers from all over the world will be able to access the information electronically, via computers. Energising Space Near Earth Fortunately for life on Earth, the terrestrial magnetic fields shield us from the full blast of the solar wind, deflecting it away from hr Earth and hollowing out a cavity in it. Yet, this magnetic cocoon, called the magnetosphere, is constantly being buffeted, distorted and reshaped by the variable solar wind, and some of it manages to penetrate the Earth's magnetic defence at its weak points. The Sun thereby feeds a vast and shifting web of energetic particles, electric currents and magnetic fields that encircle the Earth in space. The Sun's gusty solar wind can therefore affect our environment significantly. It can disturb the Earth's magnetic field, producing geomagnetic storms, create the northern and southern lights (the aurora), disrupt navigation and communication systems, destroy electronics, endanger astronauts and create electrical power blackouts on Earth. {SOHO}'s investigations of the acceleration, evolution and origin of the solar wind therefore have a direct impact on human activity. Indeed, all of these effects are of such vital importance that national centres employ space weather forecasters and continuously monitor the Sun from the ground and space to warn of threatening solar activity. The Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme - comprising of {SOHO} and its sister-mission Cluster - are aimed at obtaining a fuller understanding of the vital link between the Sun and the Earth. {SOHO} will look back at the ultimate source of it all, the Sun, in order to identify and analyse the ultimate source of the phenomena that cause terrestrial effects. Cluster will investigate in detail and - being a flotilla of four magnetospheric spacecraft - in three dimensions, the physical mature of the processes that are induced in the near-Earth environment. "All those who have worked tirelessly on the {SOHO} payload, spacecraft and ground segment are to be congratulated in their excellent work and for having developed the most remarkable tool to help us understand the Sun and its environment, the heliosphere", said Roger Bonnet.},

Assuming stochastic excitation, we estimate the energy per mode, E, and the energy supply rate, {dE}/dt. For modes with l=9-150, the mean square velocity power and the mode energy peak at about 3.15 {mHz} reaching values of 2{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.4×103 cm2 s-2 and E{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.2×1028 ergs. The energy supply rate reaches a maximum value of {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.5×1023 ergs s-1 near 3.6 {mHz}. The mode width shows the familiar “plateau” between 2.5 and 3.1 {mHz} with a “dip” near 2.9 {mHz}, which is strongest for l{\textbackslash}textasciitilde40. This dip is most prominent during solar cycle minimum and disappears with increasing magnetic activity. The energy supply rate decreases on average by about 2.7\% from the previous activity minimum to the currently highest level of activity. The solar cycle variation of {dE}/dt shows no frequency dependence, which is in marked contrast to the other mode parameters. The mode parameters are adequately represented by power laws in several frequency ranges, for example, {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitildeν6.89+/-0.07 for 2.4 {mHz}{\textbackslash}textless=ν{\textbackslash}textless3.0 {mHz} and {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitildeν-5.62+/-0.27 for 3.75 {mHz}{\textbackslash}textless=ν{\textbackslash}textless4.5 {mHz}. The solar cycle variation of these parameters can then be expressed as changes of a few percent in the power-law exponents and multipliers. Our results agree reasonably well with previous studies of Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network and Big Bear Solar Observatory data.},

	abstract = {Context. While rotation has a major impact on stellar structure and evolution, its effects are not well understood. Thanks to high-quality and long-time base photometric observations obtained with recent space missions, we are now able to study stellar rotation more precisely. Aims: We aim to constrain radial differential rotation profiles in γ Doradus (γ Dor) stars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with rapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods: We have derived a new asymptotic description which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core rotation on gravity-mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are illustrated from pulsation computations with the code {GYRE} and compared with observations of γ Dor stars. When possible, we also derived the surface rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of rotational modulation, and computed the core-to-surface rotation ratios. Results: Stellar rotation must be strongly differential before its effects on period spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing patterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained period spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai modes. Finally, we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the photometric data of eight targets. Conclusions: If only one period spacing pattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate is known as well. This is the case for eight of the stars in our sample, revealing surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95 and 1.05.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology studies the internal structure and dynamics of the sun, utilizing very precise measurements of the frequencies of sound waves that propagate throughout the solar interior and are observed at the surface. Efforts to accurately and precisely measure the mode frequencies from a single observing site have met with fundamental limitations imposed by the inevitable interruptions arising from the day-night cycle. To address such problems, the {NSF}-sponsored Global Oscillation Network Group ({GONG}) project has developed a network of six identical instruments around the world providing velocity images nearly continuously, a data processing system that can keep up with the massive data flow, and is supported by a vigorous scientific community structured around {GONG} teams that have shared in all aspects of the development of the project. Though the primary helioseismic data deals with the frequencies and their splittings for the nearly half-million global acoustic modes detectable with the {GONG} instruments, the data also allows study of how wave fields are locally influenced by flows and magnetic structures below the solar surface, and further provides direct measures of larger-scale flows at the surface. We shall briefly describe the network, instruments, and data analysis, and then review some of the preliminary scientific results obtained by the teams through inversion of the frequency data, dealing with the structure of the solar interior and the physics of stellar models, and an assessment of the differential rotation profile with depth and latitude. Early results will also be presented concerning nearly steady surface flows of the solar surface.},

	abstract = {Context. There are now more than 22 months of long-cadence data available for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in their oscillation spectra and see many components of the mixed modes that probe the stellar core. Aims: We report for the first time a parametric fit to the pattern of the ℓ = 1 mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated mixed modes. With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. Methods: We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period échelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. Results: The asymptotic relation for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of ℓ = 3 modes, of ℓ = 2 mixed modes, for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the ℓ = 1 rotational splittings. Conclusions: The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the mean large separation.

	abstract = {Internal stellar magnetic fields are inaccessible to direct observations, and little is known about their amplitude, geometry, and evolution. We demonstrate that strong magnetic fields in the cores of red giant stars can be identified with asteroseismology. The fields can manifest themselves via depressed dipole stellar oscillation modes, arising from a magnetic greenhouse effect that scatters and traps oscillation-mode energy within the core of the star. The Kepler satellite has observed a few dozen red giants with depressed dipole modes, which we interpret as stars with strongly magnetized cores. We find that field strengths larger than {\textbackslash}textasciitilde105 gauss may produce the observed depression, and in one case we infer a minimum core field strength of ≈107 gauss.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology and asteroseismology of red giant stars have shown that the distribution of angular momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with time remains an open issue in stellar physics. Owing to the unprecedented quality of Kepler photometry, we are able to seismically infer internal rotation rates in {\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma Doradus stars, which provide the {MS} counterpart to the red-giants puzzle. We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar evolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used a stellar model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain seismically inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 {\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma Doradus stars observed by Kepler. We show that the buoyancy radius can be used as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the {MS}. We computed rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in radiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the {CESTAM} code. This code calculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of the {RGB}. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear disagreement between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and the rotation rates obtained from evolutionary models including rotationally induced transport following Zahn (1992). These results show a disagreement similar to that of the Sun and red giant stars. This suggests the existence of missing mechanisms responsible for the braking of the core before and along the {MS}. The efficiency of the missing mechanisms is investigated. The transport of angular momentum as formalized by Zahn and Maeder cannot explain the measurements of near-core rotation in main-sequence intermediate-mass stars we have at hand.},

Although the pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially misaligned. We produce 12CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations and characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The {CO}-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also statistically consistent with the observed distribution of molecular outflows.

The observed precession rate is a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that once was interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity. Among the contemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet and a large tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit. Here we report that both stars of {DI} Herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicular to the orbital axis (contrary to the usual assumption for close binary stars).

	abstract = {With observations of the {EP} Cru system, we continue our series of measurements of spin-orbit angles in eclipsing binary star systems, the {BANANA} project (Binaries Are Not Always Neatly Aligned). We find a close alignment between the sky projections of the rotational and orbital angular momentum vectors for both stars (βp = -1.{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$8 {\textbackslash}pm 1.{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$6 and {\textbackslash}textbarβs{\textbackslash}textbar {\textbackslash}textless 17{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$). We also derive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages for this system. The {EP} Cru and {DI} Her systems provide an interesting comparison: they have similar stellar types and orbital properties, but {DI} Her is younger and has major spin-orbit misalignments, raising the question of whether {EP} Cru also had a large misalignment at an earlier phase of evolution. We show that tidal dissipation is an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, because realignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, and the stars in {EP} Cru are far from synchronization (they are spinning nine times too quickly). Therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, while other superficially similar binaries are formed with misaligned axes.

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \& Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60Msun\_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60Msun\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5Msun\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

Previously, similar observations did not isolate the sharp-line component, in part, because although the amplitudes of the motion observed were consistent with the stated hypothesis, the observing intervals were too short.

The evolutionary tracks from the models are examined in the light of observational data. Calculations of 15- and 20-solar-mass sequences show that - regardless of the combination of semiconvective and overshooting efficiency - no blue-supergiant phase is predicted. It is concluded that all models including the present ones erroneously predict a post-main-sequence gap.

	shorttitle = {Stellar evolution with rotation {IV}},
	abstract = {The von Zeipel theorem is generalised to account for differential rotation in the case of a “shellular” rotation law (cf. Zahn 1992). We write this law in the form Omega = Omega (r), a simplification which does not apply to fast rotation. We find that von Zeipel's relation contains a small additional term, generally further increasing the radiative flux at the pole and decreasing it at the equator. We also examine the local Eddington factor in rotating stars and notice some significant differences with respect to current expressions. We examine the latitudinal dependence of the mass loss rates dot \{M\} (vartheta ) in rotating stars and find two main source of wind anisotropies: 1) the “geff” effect which enhances the polar ejection; 2) the “opacity effect” (or “kappa -effect”), which favours equatorial ejection. In O-stars the geff effect is expected to largely dominate. In B- and later type stars the opacity effect should favour equatorial ejection and the formation of equatorial rings. We also examine the behaviour of the wind density and notice a strong enhancement at the equator of B- and later type stars. Possible relations with the polar ejections and the skirt of eta Carinae and with the inner and outer rings of {SN} 1987 A are mentioned. If dot \{M\} (vartheta ) has sharp extrema due to some peaks in the opacity law, non equatorial and symmetrical rings may be produced. We also show that the global mass loss rate of a star at a given location in the {HR} diagram is rapidly increasing with rotation, which is in good agreement with the numerical models by Friend \& Abbott (1986). Anisotropic stellar winds remove selectively the angular momentum. For example, winds passing through polar caps in O-stars remove very little angular momentum, an excess of angular momentum is thus retained and rapidly redistributed by horizontal turbulence. These excesses may lead some Wolf-Rayet stars, those resulting directly from O-stars, to be fast spinning objects, while we predict that the {WR}-stars which have passed through the red supergiant phase will have lower rotation velocities on the average. We also show how anisotropic ejection can be treated in numerical models by properly modifying the outer boundary conditions for the transport of angular momentum. Finally, in an Appendix the equation of the surface for stars with shellular rotation is discussed.},

	abstract = {The processes of semi-convection and overshooting convection have been shown to have drastic impacts on the evolution of stars; in particular, the pre-supernova structure of massive stars depends strongly on the mixing prescription of semi-convection used in 1D stellar models. This has a significant impact on the properties of the supernova and the produced nucleosynthesis (Woosley \& Heger 2002). There is currently little consensus on the most appropriate 1D models of semi-convection and overshooting convection, so we have implemented the physically-motivated semi-convection prescriptions from Wood, Garaud, \& Stellmach (2013) and Moll, Garaud, \& Stellmach (in preparation) and overshooting convection prescription from Rempel (2004) into {KEPLER}. We present the comparisons of these implementations with the previous semi-convection treatment from Langer, Fricke, \& Sugimoto (1983) for a range of massive stars.},

	abstract = {As a massive star evolves through multiple stages of nuclear burning on its way to becoming a supernova, a complex, differentially rotating structure is set up. Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields generated by the differential rotation. We present the first stellar evolution calculations to follow the evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic, from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to become a neutron star is an increasing function of main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more important role in the star's explosion. The final angular momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially by fallback, are explored.},

In the case of the gravity modes, the existence of multiple spectra some stable (g + modes) some unstable (g − modes) if superadiabatic and subadiabatic regions alternate is discussed and the interest of further investigations underlined. As far as vibrational stability (effects of the non adiabatic terms) is concerned, a general expression is given for the `damping coefficient'. The attention is drawn to the possibility for g + modes of becoming vibrationally unstable under the effect of various factors and in various models, including the Sun where this was advocated as a possibility of relieving the neutrinos difficulty.

	abstract = {Globular clusters ({GCs}) exhibit star-to-star variations in specific elements (e.g., He, C, N, O, Na, Al) that bear the hallmark of high-temperature H-burning. These abundance variations can be observed spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient {GCs}, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the {GC} population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

Equivalent widths of generally weak lines are obtained using high-signal-to-noise Reticon spectra of 39 stars in four spectral regions. Effective temperatures and gravities for these stars are derived. Projected rotational velocities are measured using a cross-correlation technique. Abundances are derived using {LTE} methods and non-{LTE} equivalent width calculations.

The observed wind terminal velocities are used with the analytic approximation for the theory of radiatively driven winds (Kudritzki et al., 1989) to obtain masses and mass loss rates. The masses derived from the spectroscopic analysis and those derived independently from the wind theory agree, except for a small difference attributed to deficiencies in the physics of the model atmospheres used. A comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that (1) evolution theory cannot explain the observed helium abundance pattern and that (2) the masses derived from the spectroscopic analysis (or the wind theory) are systematically lower than those derived from evolutionary calculations.},

Applications to massive binary systems lead to predictions for the spin rates of compact objects in binaries, and for the occurrence of gamma-ray bursts from collapsars in binaries. Rotational effects in accreting white dwarfs are found to stabilise the shell burning and decrease the carbon abundance in progenitor models for Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia supernovae, and to potentially avoid a detonation of the white dwarf within the sub-Chandrasekhar mass scenario.},

Methods: The potentials of the two distorted components can be approximated to 2nd-degree harmonics. Furthermore, both the accretion luminosity (σi) and the irradiative luminosity are included in stellar structure equations. Results: The equilibrium structure of rotationally and tidally distorted star is exactly a triaxial ellipsoids. A formula describing the isobars is presented, and the rotational velocity and the gravitational acceleration at the primary surface simulated. The results show the distortion at the outer layers of the primary increases with temporal variation and system evolution. Besides, it was observed that the luminosity accretion is unstable, and the curve of the energy-generation rate fluctuates after the main sequence in rotation sequences. The luminosity in rotation sequences is slightly weaker than that in non-rotation sequences. As a result, the volume expands slowly. Polar ejection is intensified by the tidal effect. The ejection of an equatorial ring may be favoured by both the opacity effect and the g\_e(θ,{\textbackslash}textbackslashvarphi)-effect in the binary system.},

The sequence of models for each mass might be regarded as having one small, one moderate, and two fairly rapid rotations. The convective core rotation law and overshooting are determined by two-dimensional, fully implicit hydrodynamic calculations. All models exhibit convective core overshooting. The slowly rotating models show primarily radial convective motion, while the instantaneous flow patterns of the more rapidly rotating models show that the motion is primarily parallel to the rotation axis. The resulting core rotation rate may be fitted by a power law in the distance from the rotation axis, with a cutoff at small distances from the axis, at least for the moderately and rapidly rotating models. The rotation law in the radiative region external to the convective core was chosen to be uniform for the first models calculated, but some models with negative power laws were constructed. These showed that the power law could not be too steep, or the model developed a density inversion near the rotation axis because the pressure gradient must essentially balance the rotational variation, since the gradient of the gravitational potential is too shallow to aid significantly in the balance.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to improve the modelization of the rotational mixing which occurs in stellar radiation zones, through the combined action of the thermally driven meridional circulation and of the turbulence generated by the shear of differential rotation. The turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, due to the stratification, with stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical. The main difference with the former treatments by Zahn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Zahn1992\}, A\&A, 265, 115) and Maeder \& Zahn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Maeder1998\}, A\&A, 334, 1000) is that we expand here the departures from spherical symmetry to higher order, and include explicitly the differential rotation in latitude, to first order. This allows us to treat simultaneously the bulk of a radiation zone and its tachocline(s). Moreover, we take fully into account the non-stationarity of the problem, which will enable us to tackle the rapid phases of evolution. The system of partial differential equations, which govern the transport of angular momentum, heat and chemical elements, is written in a form which makes it ready to implement in a stellar evolution code. Here the effect of a magnetic field is deliberately ignored; it will be included in forthcoming papers. Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.edpsciences.org},

A high degree of coherent structures involving downflowing plumes can be embedded in otherwise chaotic flow fields. These vortical structures play a significant role in yielding Reynolds stresses that serve to redistribute angular momentum, leading to differential rotation profiles with pole-to-equator contrasts of about 30\% in angular velocity, Omega, and some constancy along radial lines at mid latitudes, thereby making good contact with deductions from helioseismology. When a magnetic field is introduced, a dynamo regime can be found that does not destroy the strong differential rotation achieved in pure hydrodynamics cases.

This non-linear problem is solved numerically, assuming axial symmetry of the system, and within some limits it is shown that there exist simple analytical solutions. The limit of slow rotation recovers Eddington-Sweet theory, whereas it is shown that in the limit of rapid rotation the system settles into a geostrophic equilibrium. The behaviour of the system is found to be controlled by one parameter only, linked to the Prandtl number, the stratification and the rotation rate of the star.},

	abstract = {2-D stellar evolution sequences have been calculated to assess the applicability of the assumptions traditionally made in 1-D calculations for the evolution of close binaries. The companion in the 2-D calculations is assumed to be a gravitational point source. These calculations are performed from the {ZAMS} to very close to when mass transfer would begin. We find that the interior properties of the models, such as the time history of the central temperature, central density, and convective core mass are essentially unchanged in the 2-D models from the 1- D results. This is true even though the convective core is not quite spherically symmetric, but slightly elongated in the direction of the companion. We treat the 2-D model surface as an equipotential. The surface matches that of a Roche potential closely until the elongation toward the companion is close to that required for mass transfer. Moreover, the surface evolution as Roche lobe overflow is approached becomes so rapid that the surface may not be able to adjust sufficiently fast to remain an equipotential. We conclude the 1-D approach is satisfactory through the events covered by our calculations except possibly just before mass transfer begins.},

	abstract = {Recent asteroseismic advances have allowed for direct measurements of the internal rotation rates of many subgiant and red giant stars. Unlike the nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the role of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low-mass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively excited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into subgiants, however, low-frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and cannot propagate below the hydrogen-burning shell, allowing the spin of the core to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the base of the subgiant branch when stars have surface temperatures of T ≈ 5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region, implying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep core near the hydrogen-burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region may also prevent the core from accreting high angular momentum material and slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance shear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of viscous/magnetic torques.},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in constant rotation surfaces, the isorotational contours of the solar convective zone may be reproduced with great fidelity. Even at this early stage of development, this helioseismology fit may be used to put a lower bound on the mid-latitude radial solar entropy gradient, which is in good accord with standard mixing length theory. In this paper, we generalize this solar calculation to fully convective stars (and potentially planets), retaining the assumptions of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in isorotational surfaces. It is found that each isorotation contour is of the form R2 = A + {BΦ}(r), where R is the radius from the rotation axis, Φ(r) is the (assumed spherical) gravitational potential, and A and B are constants along the contour. This result is applied to simple models of fully convective stars. Both solar-like surface rotation profiles (angular velocity decreasing toward the poles) as well as `antisolar' profiles (angular velocity increasing toward the poles) are modelled; the latter bear some suggestive resemblance to numerical simulations. We also perform exploratory studies of zonal surface flows similar to those seen in Jupiter and Saturn. In addition to providing a practical framework for understanding the results of large-scale numerical simulations, our findings may also prove useful in dynamical calculations for which a simple but viable model for the background rotation profile in a convecting fluid is needed. Finally, our work bears directly on an important goal of the {CoRoT} programme: to elucidate the internal structure of rotating, convecting stars.},

Our assumptions are considerably less restrictive than those of previous analyses. The angular velocity need not have cylindrical isorotational surfaces, and a priori convective stability is not assumed. In an unmagnetized gas, stability under these circumstances would be governed by the Høland criteria. These criteria change qualitatively when even a weak magnetic field is present. In a magnetized plasma, the new criteria for stability have the same general form exhibited by the purely hydrodynamical case, but with all angular momentum gradients replaced by angular velocity gradients. Our findings are in accord with those of Papaloizou \& Szuszkiewicz, who, using very different methods, considered the stability of isorotational field configurations. The results presented here thus point very generally to angular velocity gradients, not angular momentum gradients, as the fundamental stability discriminants in rotating astrophysical plasmas.},

	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 12 Msun with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 40 Msun and fast rotation, a bluewards “homogeneous-like” track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Lyu96\}).},

Recent numerical simulations suggest that the model by Zahn (1992, A\&A, 265, 115) for the turbulent mixing of chemical elements due to differential rotation in stellar radiative zones is valid. Aims: We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the numerical configuration and Reynolds number of the flow. Methods: We compare results from simulations performed with two different numerical codes, including one that uses the shearing-box formalism. We also extensively study the dependence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient on the turbulent Reynolds number. Results: The two numerical codes used in this study give consistent results. The turbulent diffusion coefficient is independent of the size of the numerical domain if at least three large turbulent structures fit in the box. Generally, the turbulent diffusion coefficient depends on the turbulent Reynolds number. However, our simulations suggest that an asymptotic regime is obtained when the turbulent Reynolds number is larger than 103. Conclusions: Shear mixing in the regime of small Péclet numbers can be investigated numerically both with shearing-box simulations and simulations using explicit forcing. Our results suggest that Zahn's model is valid at large turbulent Reynolds numbers.},

	abstract = {Stars between two and three solar masses rotate rapidly on the main sequence, and the detection of slow core and surface rotation in the core-helium burning phase for these stars places strong constraints on their angular momentum transport and loss. From a detailed asteroseismic study of the mixed-dipole mode pattern in a carefully selected, representative sample of stars, we find that slow core rotation rates in the range reported by prior studies are a general phenomenon and not a selection effect. We show that the core rotation rates of these stars decline strongly with decreasing surface gravity during the core He-burning phase. We argue that this is a model-independent indication of significant rapid angular momentum transport between the cores and envelopes of these stars. We see a significant range in core rotation rates at all surface gravities, with little evidence for a convergence towards a uniform value. We demonstrate using evolutionary models that measured surface rotation periods are a biased tracer of the true surface rotation distribution, and argue for using stellar models for interpreting the contrast between core and surface rotation rates. The core rotation rates we measure do not have a strong mass or metallicity dependence. We argue that the emerging data strongly favors a model where angular momentum transport is much more efficient during the core He burning phase than in the shell burning phases which precede and follow it.},

	abstract = {Rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, with far reaching consequences for stellar evolution. Nitrogen surface abundances for a large and homogeneous sample of massive B-type stars in the {LMC} were obtained by the {VLT}-{FLAMES} Survey of Massive Stars. This sample is the first covering a broad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enough sample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis. We use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory of rotational mixing in massive stars. We calculated a grid of stellar evolution models, using the {FLAMES} sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixing processes. We developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this grid to simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotational velocity distributions consistent with those from the {FLAMES} sample. The synthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in the observed sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical results and theoretical predictions. Our simulations reproduce the fraction of stars without significant nitrogen enrichment. The predicted number of rapid rotators with enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally. Furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enriched objects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can not be reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. Additional physical processes appear to be required to understand the population of massive main-sequence stars from the {FLAMES} sample.We discuss the possible role of binary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. We find that the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikely produced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binary systems},

	abstract = {In this paper we present two new results. The first concerns the proper identification of the critical Richardson number Ri(cr) above which there is no longer turbulent mixing. Thus far, all studies have assumed that: Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) = 1/4. However, since Riell(cr) determines the upper limit of a laminar regime (superscript l), it has little relevance to stars where the problem is not to determine the end point of a laminar regime but the endpoint of turbulence. We show that the latter is characterized by Rit (cr), where t stands for turbulence, and has a value four times larger than (1): Ri (cr) = Rit (cr) ≈ 4 Riell (cr)≈ 1. We also show that use of (2) instead of (1) changes the conclusions of recent studies. Inclusion of radiative losses (characterized by the Peclet number Pe) which weaken stable stratification and help turbulence, further changes (2) to (r stands for radiative): Ri (cr) = Rir (cr) {\textbackslash}textasciitilde (1+Pe)Pe-1 Rit (cr) which, for Pe{\textbackslash}textless1, allows turbulence to survive far longer than (2). Finally, turbulent convection generates gravity waves that propagate into the radiative region and act as an additional source of energy. This further changes Eq. (3) to (gw stands for gravity waves): Ri (cr) = Rigw (cr) =Rir (1+ηgw) where etagw {\textbackslash}textgreater1. In conclusion, the successive inclusion of relevant physical processes leads to a chain of increasing values of Ri (cr): Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) → Rit (cr)→ Riˆr (cr)→ Rigw (cr). The second result concerns the dependence of the diffusivity D on Omega . We show that the commonly used expression Dχ-1{\textbackslash}textasciitilde (Ω/N)2 is not correct for the regime Pe{\textbackslash}textless1 that characterizes a stably stratified regime. The proper Omega -dependence is: Dχ-1{\textbackslash}textasciitilde (Ω/N)4.},

Multiple linear regression to estimate the nitrogen abundance combined with principal components analysis, after addressing the incomplete and truncated nature of the data, reveals that the effective temperature and the frequency of the dominant acoustic oscillation mode are the only two significant predictors for the nitrogen abundance, while the projected rotational velocity and the rotational frequency have no predictive power. The dominant gravity mode and the magnetic field strength are correlated with the effective temperature but have no predictive power for the nitrogen abundance.

	abstract = {Theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that most of the lithium inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However, observations reveal that about 1\% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the big bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2330 low-mass (1–3 M ⊙) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning cores (), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations for the origin of lithium-rich giants. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a binary companion.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0005280},
	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We suggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper mixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars, the Li-rich phase occurs on the early-{AGB}. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 12 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M \&gt;{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 40 M{\textbackslash}{textlessSUB}{\textbackslash}textgreatersun{\textbackslash}textless/{SUB}{\textbackslash}textgreater and fast rotation, a bluewards “homogeneous-like” track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Lyu96\}).},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26A...359..563C/abstract},
	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, five appear to be Li-rich because they have not completed the standard first dredge-up dilution, and three have abundances compatible with the maximum allowed by standard dilution. Thus, these should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. At this evolutionary phase, the outwardly-moving hydrogen shell burns through the mean molecular weight discontinuity created by the first dredge-up. Any extra-mixing process can now easily connect the {\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater3{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}{textgreaterHe}-rich envelope material to the outer regions of the hydrogen-burning shell, enabling Li production by the Cameron \&amp; Fowler (1971) process. While very high Li abundances are then reached, this Li-rich phase is extremely short lived because once the mixing extends deep enough to lower the carbon isotopic ratio below the standard dilution value, the freshly synthesized Li is quickly destroyed. In intermediate-mass stars, the mean molecular weight gradient due to the first dredge-up is not erased until after the star has begun to burn helium in its core. The Li-rich phase in these stars occurs when the convective envelope deepens at the base of the {AGB}, permitting extra-mixing to play an effective role. Li production ceases when a strong mean molecular weight gradient is built up between the deepening convective envelope and the shell of nuclear burning that surrounds the inert {CO} core. This episode is also very short lived. Low-mass stars may undergo additional mixing at this phase. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

	abstract = {Recent asteroseismic advances have allowed for direct measurements of the internal rotation rates of many subgiant and red giant stars. Unlike the nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the role of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low-mass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively excited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into subgiants, however, low-frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and cannot propagate below the hydrogen-burning shell, allowing the spin of the core to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the base of the subgiant branch when stars have surface temperatures of T ≈ 5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region, implying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep core near the hydrogen-burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region may also prevent the core from accreting high angular momentum material and slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance shear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of viscous/magnetic torques.},

	abstract = {Many stars exhibit strong magnetic fields, some of which are thought to be of primordial origin and others a sign of magnetic dynamo processes. We briefly review the results of observational studies of solar-type stars seeking to evaluate the linkage between rotation rate and possible magnetic cycles of activity. Clearly turbulent convection and rotation within spherical shell geometries provide ingredients essential for dynamo action. However, intensive efforts over several decades in solar research have demonstrated that it is no easy matter to achieve cyclic magnetic activity that is in accord with observations. Helioseismology has revealed that an essential element for the global solar dynamo is the presence of a tachocline of shear at the base of the solar convection zone, leading to the likely operation of an interface dynamo. We review the crucial elements for achieving a cyclic magnetic activity. We then discuss some of our current 3 D {MHD} simulations of solar turbulent convection in spherical shells that yield differential rotation profiles which make good contact with some of the helioseismic findings. We show that such turbulent motions can amplify and sustain magnetic field in the bulk of the convective zone whose strength are sufficient to feed back both upon the convection and its global circulations.},

	abstract = {Double-lined eclipsing binaries with accurate absolute dimensions are the best stellar data to test tidal evolution theories due to the high dependency of the time scales on masses, relative radii and periods. In a preceding paper we have probed the hydrodynamical mechanism against the observed levels of synchronization and circularization for about 40 close binary systems with accurate absolute dimensions. In the present work we extend our investigations, using the same systems as a control, to the turbulent dissipation and radiative damping mechanisms which have been studied by Zahn. The time scales for these processes are characterized by the parameters λ\_2\_ and E\_2\_ respectively. These parameters were computed for a wide grid of stellar models and they are presented, for the first time, as functions of the mass and time. The differential equations which govern the orbital parameters were integrated using our recent grids of stellar models (Claret 1995A\&amp;{AS}..109..441C, 1997, A\&amp;{AS} submitted; Claret \&amp; Gimenez 1995A\&amp;A...296..180C, 1995A\&amp;{AS}..114..549C). The derived critical times and radii were compared with observations of synchronization and circularization levels. Within uncertainties, the formalisms by Zahn seem to be able to explain the eccentricity distribution around the zero point of the diagram log (age/t\_cri\_) x eccentricity although they can not explain some systems with circular orbits which present ages smaller than their respective critical times. We have also introduced a diagram based on the integration of the differential equations which proved to be useful to test theoretical predictions for the relationship age x Period (cut-off) for clusters. Using this diagram we have shown that the turbulent friction mechanism is not dissipative enough to explain such an observational relationship. However, as these results are valid only for little departure from synchronism and small eccentricity, we plan to investigate the influence of the initial conditions in a forthcoming paper.},

It is demonstrated that most of the orbital circularization occurs during the Hayashi phase, and that the subsequent decrease in eccentricity on the main-sequence is negligible. The theoretical cutoff period, which separates the circular from the eccentric systems, lies between 7.2 and 8.5 days, depending on the masses and on the assumptions made about the initial conditions; it agrees well with the observed period of about 8 days. This cutoff period is a function of the initial radius of the stars on the Hayashi track. In these calculations, the values predicted by the star formation theory of Stahler et al. (1980) are used; hence the good agreement mentioned above provides a new validation of that theory. It is also shown that systems around that cutoff period reach the zero-age main-sequence with their components rotating faster than the orbital rate.},

As a corollary of the stability analysis, we conclude that the loss of a significant fraction of a star's angular momentum must be accompanied by the mixing of material below its convective zone. Such mixing inevitably leads to the depletion of lithium in the star's photosphere.},

The turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, with stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical, thereby enforcing a rotation rate which depends only on depth, to first approximation. This conjecture is supported by the interior rotation of the Sun, which is now being revealed through acoustic sounding. The main result is that both the meridian circulation and the turbulence are determined by the loss of angular momentum, which the author ascribes here solely to a stellar wind. When there is no wind, the meridian flow is very weak, and it can even vanish in slow rotators. When the wind is active, it drives the circulation in order to transport angular momentum to the surface, but the advection of chemical species by this flow is partly inhibited because of the horizontal turbulence.},

	abstract = {Models of stellar evolution with rotation are very much needed in order to interpret recent stellar properties, in particular for massive stars. For that we proceed to a detailed investigation of some critical physical processes in rotating stars: 1. The equation expressing the transport of angular momentum by circulation and diffusion is revised to also account for expansion and contraction in non-stationary models. 2. We examine the current expressions for the velocity U(r) of the meridional circulation, also taking into account mu -gradients and horizontal turbulence. We show that there are no “mu -currents” but just meridional currents which can be sizeably influenced by the gradients of mean molecular weight mu . A proper account of the mu -gradients may reduce U(r) by one or two orders of magnitude with respect to current expressions. 3. While the usual expressions for the meridional circulation would predict an infinite velocity at the edge of a radiative and semiconvective zone and an inverted circulation in a semiconvective zone, the present developments give a continuity of the solutions for the circulation. 4. The approximation of a stationary circulation, which is no longer valid after the main-sequence phase, is also removed and the case of a general equation of state is considered. We notice that in the stationary regime the horizontal fluctuations of mu represent some fixed fraction of the vertical mu -gradient. To first order, this fraction is not dependent on rotation, because the building of horizontal fluctuations by the circulation is compensated by the smoothing due to horizontal turbulence.},

In the case of the gravity modes, the existence of multiple spectra some stable (g + modes) some unstable (g − modes) if superadiabatic and subadiabatic regions alternate is discussed and the interest of further investigations underlined. As far as vibrational stability (effects of the non adiabatic terms) is concerned, a general expression is given for the `damping coefficient'. The attention is drawn to the possibility for g + modes of becoming vibrationally unstable under the effect of various factors and in various models, including the Sun where this was advocated as a possibility of relieving the neutrinos difficulty.

	abstract = {The weak friction model for tidal interaction in a close binary system is investigated, in which the tides assume their equilibrium shape, but with a constant time lag, and the model is used to derive explicit equations of tidal evolution. An elementary derivation is presented of the perturbing tidal forces, and the perturbations are used to derive differential equations for the evolution of several orbital and rotational parameters of the binary system. Energy and angular momentum considerations are used directly instead of the general perturbation techniques of celestial mechanics. The tidal evolution equations are analyzed locally around equilibrium configurations. Time scales are derived for the rate of change of the semimajor axis, the rotational velocity, and for the eccentricity and inclination, which go to zero asymptotically. The global aspects of the tidal evolution equations are analyzed. For the case of small inclinations but arbitrary eccentricity, a complete classification is made of all types of tidal evolution possible in the model which is presented. Several relations are obtained analytically from the equations for tidal evolution in the weak friction model. The presented model is simple, but it is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide class of binary stars},

The interior and envelope solutions in this procedure are derived in Sections 2 and 3. The results apply to stars which have a convective core and a radiative envelope, and they are discussed in Section 4. We find that the resonances of the free gravity modes are damped by radiative dissipation, which operates in a relatively thin region below the surface of the star. Due to that dissipation, some properties of the dynamical tide have observable consequences in close binary systems: (1) A torque is applied to a binary component; this serves to make it corotate with its companion in a time which can be short compared to its nuclear life. (2) Before that synchronization is achieved, the brightness distribution over the surface of the star is in general phase shifted relative to the external driving potential.},

It also helps to set constraints for cosmological models. The presence of very strong lithium lines in some giant stars of different spectral types and stages of evolution has been considered up to the end of the nineties as a puzzle. To solve this problem, non standard evolutionary mechanisms must be invoked. We review here all the mechanisms presented in the literature and which are divided into internal and external processes of lithium enrichment. We will also discuss the observational tests which are being performed in order to discard (or not) some of them. In any case, the more realistic values of the lithium abundances in giants are, as we will see, the main test of these proposed scenarios. Because of this importance we discuss here the state of art of the Non-{LTE} determinations of lithium abundances in strong lithium giants. Evolved giants, with lithium abundances larger than that of the interstellar medium and with their important mass losses can be considered the most realistic sources of lithium in the Galaxy. We believe that a complete physical picture of this problem will give a powerful tool to understand the chemical evolution of a large part of all light elements.},

	abstract = {The hydrodynamics of meridional circulation in the radiative zone of a rotating star has been studied. The Eddington-Sweet formulation of the circulation velocity, in which the convective transport of energy by the flow is assumed to compensate for the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux, is confirmed for a "slowly" rotating star. On the other hand, apparent singularities of the circulation velocity in the case = a and near the stellar surface are found to be due to improper uses of the Eddington-Sweet formulation. When the convective transport of energy is inefficient, the energy equation reduces to the thermal conduction equation, in which the excess or deficiency of the radiation flux results in local heating or cooling, and the star manages ot redistribute angular velocity of rotation in such a way that there is no meridional circulation. The Goldreich-Schubert instability destroys the above-mentioned steady rotation, but it is argued that a new steady state is likely to be established in which a balance exists between the meridional circulation and the irregular motion due to this instability.

	doi = {10.1007/BF00645172},
	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the dynamical problem of tidal friction in a binary system consisting of deformable components, with the restriction that the angle of lag or advance of the tidal distortion with respect to the direction of the disturbing companion is small. The fractional distortion of the bodies due to rotation and tidal interaction is also treated as a first-order small quantity, and terms up to the fourth harmonic in the tidal potential are retained. In this linear approximation, the time-dependent tidal potential can be Fourier decomposed into a spectrum of simple harmonic terms, each of which is responsible for raising a `partial wave' in the body; each such partial wave can then be treated independently of the others. This is the method first employed by Darwin. In Section 2, it is assumed that the phase lag in the response of the body (due to dissipation of kinetic energy of deformation) is proportional to the forcing frequency, which is justified for small amplitude oscillations of a viscous fluid or visco-elastic body. A simple expression is then obtained for the potential function for the distortion in terms of the disturbing potential and the structure of the body. In Section 3, the distortion potential function is employed in deriving the {componentsR}, S {andW} of the disturbing force which are then substituted in the Gaussian form of the equations for variation of the elements. In Section 4, the Eulerian equations for motion of deformable bodies are derived, using the so-called `mean axes' of the body as the rotating axes of reference. In Section 5, it is shown that the dynamical effects of rotational distortion occur on a much shorter time scale than those arising from tidal friction, which allows one to consider the two phenomena as acting independently of one another. The collected set of Gaussian (orbital) and Eulerian (body) equations is re-written in terms of dimensionless variables for the tidal friction case, and the stability of the system is examined on the basis of these equations. In Section 6, the tidal friction equations are integrated numerically for the close binary system {AG} Persei and for the Earth-Moon system. In the former, the integrations were started from a highly elliptical orbit and the system was found to relax into a circular orbit, with synchronous rotation perpendicular to the orbit. In the latter, the integrations were performed backwards in time from the present day, and it was found that the lunar orbit rapidly becomes highly elliptical at the time of closest approach, thus indicating a probable capture of the Moon by the Earth. This result is in agreement with that obtained by other investigators; however, it is shown that the detailed behaviour of the system at the time of capture, in particular the inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic, depends critically on the chosen rate of dissipation in the Moon's interior. A simple argument is presented which allows an estimation for the mean viscosity of a fluid body from the known age of the system: for the components of {AG} per, the result is 2×10{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater11{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater g cm{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater s{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater, indicating that the stars must have possessed turbulent convective outer regions during some part of their tidal evolution, while for the Earth, the result, is 1.4×10{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater12{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater g cm{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater s{\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater-1{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater.

	abstract = {It is suggested that p modes in the sun are on average excited to a surface amplitude which is solely a function of frequency, except in the case of modes of the highest degree. Observational data in the 2-4 {mHz} range seem to be consistent with this hypothesis. The sharp-line component first reported by Claverie et al (1979) in the power spectra of whole-disc measurements is due to a near coincidence of the eigenfrequencies of modes of low degree, which are the modes to which such measurements are most sensitive. Previously, similar observations did not isolate the sharp-line component, in part, because although the amplitudes of the motion observed were consistent with the stated hypothesis, the observing intervals were too short. The amplitudes of the higher-degree modes responsible for the five-minute oscillations reported by Leighton. Noyes and Simon (1962) are also essentially in accord with the hypothesis presented.},

	abstract = {Secular changes brought about by tidal friction in the solar system are reviewed. The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 {\textbackslash}{textlessSUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater4{\textbackslash}textless/{SUP}{\textbackslash}textgreater. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

Efforts to accurately and precisely measure the mode frequencies from a single observing site have met with fundamental limitations imposed by the inevitable interruptions arising from the day-night cycle. To address such problems, the {NSF}-sponsored Global Oscillation Network Group ({GONG}) project has developed a network of six identical instruments around the world providing velocity images nearly continuously, a data processing system that can keep up with the massive data flow, and is supported by a vigorous scientific community structured around {GONG} teams that have shared in all aspects of the development of the project. Though the primary helioseismic data deals with the frequencies and their splittings for the nearly half-million global acoustic modes detectable with the {GONG} instruments, the data also allows study of how wave fields are locally influenced by flows and magnetic structures below the solar surface, and further provides direct measures of larger-scale flows at the surface. We shall briefly describe the network, instruments, and data analysis, and then review some of the preliminary scientific results obtained by the teams through inversion of the frequency data, dealing with the structure of the solar interior and the physics of stellar models, and an assessment of the differential rotation profile with depth and latitude. Early results will also be presented concerning nearly steady surface flows of the solar surface.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of mode width, Γ, and mean square velocity power, 2{\textbackslash}textgreater, derived from all currently processed 108 day Global Oscillation Network Group ({GONG}) time series and discuss their implications for p-mode excitation and damping. Assuming stochastic excitation, we estimate the energy per mode, E, and the energy supply rate, {dE}/dt. For modes with l=9-150, the mean square velocity power and the mode energy peak at about 3.15 {mHz} reaching values of 2{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.4×103 cm2 s-2 and E{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.2×1028 ergs. The energy supply rate reaches a maximum value of {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.5×1023 ergs s-1 near 3.6 {mHz}. The mode width shows the familiar “plateau” between 2.5 and 3.1 {mHz} with a “dip” near 2.9 {mHz}, which is strongest for l{\textbackslash}textasciitilde40. This dip is most prominent during solar cycle minimum and disappears with increasing magnetic activity. The energy supply rate decreases on average by about 2.7\% from the previous activity minimum to the currently highest level of activity. The solar cycle variation of {dE}/dt shows no frequency dependence, which is in marked contrast to the other mode parameters. The mode parameters are adequately represented by power laws in several frequency ranges, for example, {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitildeν6.89+/-0.07 for 2.4 {mHz}{\textbackslash}textless=ν{\textbackslash}textless3.0 {mHz} and {dE}/dt{\textbackslash}textasciitildeν-5.62+/-0.27 for 3.75 {mHz}{\textbackslash}textless=ν{\textbackslash}textless4.5 {mHz}. The solar cycle variation of these parameters can then be expressed as changes of a few percent in the power-law exponents and multipliers. Our results agree reasonably well with previous studies of Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network and Big Bear Solar Observatory data.},

	abstract = {{SOHO} will carry twelve sophisticated telescopes and other instruments, developed in record time by twelve international consortia involving scientific institutes in 15 countries. Roger M. Bonnet, the Director of {ESA}'s Scientific Programme said: "Each one of these instruments by itself would be enough to make major breakthroughs in our understanding of the Sun. But what makes {SOHO} such an exciting mission is that we will operate all the instruments together and find possible links between various phenomena at different levels in the volume of the Sun and in the interplanetary medium". Four years of intense efforts by space engineering teams in {ESA} and across Europe, under the leadership of the prime contractor Matra Marconi Space of Toulouse, France, have fulflled the dream of scientists who wished to build a superb space observatory for examining the Sun. {SOHO}, together with the four-spacecraft Cluster mission - which will explore near-Earth space, forms the Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme, the first cornerstone in {ESA}'s long-term programme 'Horizon 2000'. No night time for {SOHO} Instead of being placed in orbit around the Earth, {SOHO} will be lofted to a position where the gravitational pulls of the Earth and the Sun cancel each other out exactly, at 1.5 million kilometres sunward from the Earth. This is known in astronomy as the inner Lagrangian point after the French mathematician, Joseph Louis Lagrange, who first calculated its position near the end of the eighteenth century. {SOHO} will fly in an elliptical, or "halo" orbit around the Lagrangian point, with an orbit radius of about 600,000 kilometres, allowing the spacecraft to experience perpetual day. It will have a continuous, uninterrupted view of the Sun for twenty four hours of the day, all three hundred and sixty five days of the year, producing an extraordinary amount of data. All previous solar observatories have either been on the Earth or in orbit around our planet. On the Earth, telescopes are limited by inclement weather conditions and atmospheric distortion of the Sun's signal, and of course they cannot observe the Sun at night. Although the weather problem has been removed in orbit around the Earth, observations are still periodically interrupted when an Earth-orbiting spacecraft enters our planet's shadow. In contrast, {SOHO} will provide the first long, clean uninterrupted views of the Sun. Science Objectives {SOHO} will look beyond the visible soar disk, observing through new windows from the centre of the Sun to the Earth. It will examine three regions - the hidden interior of the Sun, the hot transparent solar atmosphere, and the eternal solar wind of charged particles and magnetic fields that continuously flow outward from the Sun. The twelve instruments on board {SOHO} are designed to study one or two of these regions in a different, yet complimentary way. Their combined data will link events in the Sun's atmosphere and solar wind changes taking place deep within the Sun. The {SOHO} mission has three principle scientific objectives: 1. Study of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior 2. Study of the heating mechanisms of the Sun's million-degree atmosphere, or solar corona 3. Investigation of the solar wind, its origin and its acceleration processes. "Never before have solar physicists had the opportunity to work with such a comprehensive observatory giving them access literally to the whole Sun", said Martin C. E. Huber, the Head of {ESA}'s Space Science Department. Taking the pulse of the Sun {SOHO} wil illuminate the unseen depths of the Sun by recording widespread throbbing motions of the Sun's visible "surface", or photosphere. These oscillations are caused by sounds that are trapped inside the Sun. On striking the surface and rebounding back down, the sound waves cause the gases there to move up and down. Sound waves that penetrate deep within the Sun produce global surface oscillations with longer periods of up to a few hours; smaller, shorter oscillations refer to shallower layers. By considering a sequence of oscillations with longer and longer periods, describing sound waves that penetrate deeper and deeper, {SOHO} will 'peel away' progressively distant layers of the Sun and establish physical properties inside the Sun's deep interior. Since the technique is similar in scientific principle to using earthquakes, or seismic waves, to decipher the Earth's internal structure, it has become known as helioseismology. {SOHO}'s helioseismology data may shed light on solar neutrinos; they are insubstantial, subatomic particles created in prodigious quantities inside the Sun's energy-generating core. Neutrinos move at the velocity of light and travel almost unimpeded through the Sun, the Earth and nearly any amount of matter. The difficulty is that underground detectors always observe fewer neutrinos than theory says they should detect, a discrepancy known as the solar neutrino problem. Either the Sun does not shine the way we think it ought to, or our basic understanding of neutrinos is in error. {SOHO}'s record of surface oscillations may establish the temperature at the centre of the Sun, and tell us if there is something wrong with our knowledge of the way stars shine. If the centre of the Sun is about a million degrees cooler than is presently thought, nuclear reactions would produce fewer neutrinos and resolve the solar neutrino problem. But if the internal temperature has the expected value, then the neutrinos may have an identity crisis, undergoing metamorphosis before reaching terrestrial detectors that therefore cannot see them. Future {SOHO} helioseismology observations will also improve our understanding of the solar dynamo responsible for the Sun's magnetic field. The dynamo is located somewhere in the solar interior where the hot, rotating material generates electrical currents and converts the energy of motion into magnetic energy. Magnetic fields, spawned by the dynamo inside the Sun, thread their way out into the solar atmosphere where they mould the electrified gas into an ever-changing shape. The entire atmosphere is continuously transformed by the Sun's varying magnetism, producing activity on a scale unknown on Earth. Looking inside the Sun There are three helioseismology experts on board {SOHO} that will acquire long uninterrupted observations of solar oscillations. Two of them emphasise global, long-period oscillations and sound waves that can penetrate the deep solar interior. They are known as {GOLF}, for Global Oscillations at Low Frequency, and {VIRGO}, an acronym for Variability of solar {IRradiance} and Gravity Oscillations. The third {SOHO} helioseismology instrument will obtain data for oscillations on smaller spatial scales with unprecedented precision; it is called the Solar Oscillations Investigation/Michelson Doppler Imager, or {SOI}/{MDI} for short. {GOLF} and {MDI} employ the familiar Doppler technique for measuring motions of the solar photosphere. When part of the visible surface heaves up towards us, the wavelength of a spectral line formed in that region is shortened; if the region moves away from us, back toward the solar interior, the wavelength is lengthened. (A spectral line absorbed or emitted by an atom or an ion at a specific wavelength that identifies the element; it looks like a line in a spectral display of radiation intensity as a function of wavelength). Sound waves can also be used to determine the internal rotation of the Sun. Waves propagating in the direction of rotation will appear, to a fixed observer, to move faster and their measure speeds will be shorter. Waves propagating against the rotation will be slowed down with longer periods. Accurate measurements of this oscillation period splitting will determine rotation within the solar interior. {GOLF} aims to measure velocities as low as 1 millimetre per second for global surface oscillations with periods from 3 minutes to 100 days. {SOI}/{MDI} will obtain precise oscillation data with high spatial resolution, investigating surface oscillations of relatively small spatial scales and short periods. Both instruments will determine the radial distribution of density, pressure and temperature, establish the depth and latitude variation of rotation, and determine interior conditions that lead to the development of solar magnetic activity. {VIRGO} will measure variations in the Sun's irradiance, or its total luminous output, with extremely accurate, precise and stable radiometers. As the Sun fades and brightens, {VIRGO} will obtain a sensitive record of global, long-period oscillations, refining our knowledge of the physical and dynamic properties of the deep solar interior. The precise, long-duration measurements from {GOLF} and {VIRGO} may also lead to the unambiguous detection of solar waves for the first time. They are largely confined to the Sun's energy-generating core, and the force of gravity determines how quickly they rise and fall, much like waves in the ocean. Gravity waves that manage to reach the visible solar surface are expected to have long periods of an hour or more and to reveal conditions at the very centre of the Sun. They will shed new light on the solar neutrino problem and determine if the Sun's rotation speed increase near its centre. The Solar Atmosphere The entire Sun is just a huge, gaseous sphere that is compressed at its centre and becomes tenuous further out. So, the sharp visible edge of the Sun is an illusion. It is enveloped by gases that are so rarefied that we can see right through them, just as we see through the Earth's transparent air. This tenuous outer part of the Sun is therefore called the solar atmosphere. The lowest, densest level of the Sun's atmosphere is the photosphere, which simply means the sphere from which visible light comes - from the Greek photos for light. Just above the photosphere lies a thin layer called the chromosphere, from chromos, the Greek work for colour. Still higher, above the chromosphere, is the corona, or crown; this outermost layer of the solar atmosphere extends to the planets and beyond. The solar corona is extremely hot, with a temperature of a few million degrees. Its very existence is one of the most fundamental, unresolved paradoxes of modern solar physics. The photosphere is closer to the Sun's centre than the corona, but it is several hundred times cooler. Heat should not flow outward from a cooler to a hotter region; it violates common sense and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite more than a half century of investigation, the exact mechanism for heating corona still remains a mystery, and it is one of the main scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission. Sunlight passes right through the corona without depositing substantial quantities of energy in it. So, radiation cannot resolve the heating problem. Possible mechanisms involve the kinetic energy of moving material and/or magnetic energy. Unlike radiation, both of these forms of energy can flow from cold to hot regions. In and out motions within the solar interior within the solar interior generate sound waves that could accelerate into supersonic shocks; they apparently dissipate energy and generate heat in the lower chromosphere. However, observations suggest that sound waves cannot significantly heat the corona since they cannot reach that far. {SOHO} will test this conclusion, looking for the varying spectral signatures of sound waves in the chromosphere and corona. Magnetic energy should play a role in coronal heating. Magnetic fields shape the highly structured corona, and the brightest coronal structures are located where the magnetic field is the strongest. {SOHO}'s spectral instruments will therefore also look for the oscillating intensity and velocity signatures of magnetic waves that are produced by changing magnetism. Magnetic energy can also be converted into heat by numerous small, localised explosive events that have already been observed with space-borne telescopes at ultraviolet wavelengths. {SOHO} will provide new insight to the frequency, locations and power of such explosions. {SOHO} tunes in the Sun's atmosphere The solar atmosphere will be studied by five {SOHO} instruments. Three of them will study the chromosphere and the transition region in the low corona. They are known as {SUMER} for Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of Emitted Radiation, {CDS}, an acronym for Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer, and {EIT}, which is short for Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope. Two {SOHO} instruments will examine the middle corona between 1.1 and 10 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre. They are known as {UVCS} for {UltraViolet} Coronagraph Spectrometer and {LASCO}, an acronym for Large Angle and Spectrometric {COronagraph}. Four of these instruments detect invisible radiation at ultraviolet ({UV}) or extreme ultraviolet ({EUV}) wavelengths. {UV} light has wavelengths somewhat less that those of visible light, and waves of {EUV} are a little shorter than the {UV} ones. Since this radiation is partially or totally absorbed in our air, it must be observe using telescopes that have been lofted above the Earth's obscuring atmosphere in satellites such as {SOHO}. We can tune into different parts of the solar atmosphere by isolating {UV} or {EUV} radiation at just one wavelength and forming an image there. Certain {UV} and {EUV} lines act like thermometers, specifying the temperature when they are formed, while others are sensitive to the local density. Velocities of moving material can also be inferred from wavelength shifts or broadening of the lines. Temperature, density, and velocity measurements from all four experiments will be used to specify heating, flows and wave motions in different magnetic structures and at various levels in the solar atmosphere. When combined, they will uniquely describe an unseen world of violent change, extreme temperatures and powerful explosion, quite unlike the bland white-light face of the Sun. {SUMER}, {CDS} and {EIT} will observe lines over a temperature range of 10,000 to a few million degrees, and determine velocities down to 1 kilometre per second. {SUMER} and {CSA} will obtain images of the chromosphere and corona with high spatial and temporal resolution (down to 1 second of arc and as brief as 1 second) with a field view of about 4 minutes of arc; {EIT} will provide full disk images with coarser resolution. {UVCS} is an occulted telescope equipped to measure {UV} line intensities and profiles, determining physical parameters of the solar corona from 1.2 to 10 solar radii from Sun-centre with an angular resolution down to 12 seconds of arc. The remaining {SOHO} atmosphere instrument, {LASCO}, uses an occulting disk to mask the Sun's photosphere and view the dim visible sunlight scattered by free coronal electrons. (At a million degrees, several electrons are set free from each atom, leaving an ion behind.) Since the sky's light confuses such images, the finest detail is obtained from space where the daytime sky is truly and starkly black. The {LASCO} instrument contains three such coronagraphs with nested and overlapping annular fields of view from 1.1 to 30 solar radii from Sun-centre, looking closer to, and further from, the Sun than all previous space-borne coronagraphs. The coronagraph images will provide electron densities, or the number of electrons per unit volume, specifying their global distribution and radial variation. The inner coronagraph will also permit high-resolution imaging spectroscopy from 1.1 to 3 solar radii. It will measure the intensities and wavelength (Doppler) shifts of visible lines emitted by coronal ions, determining temperature, density and velocity information that will also be used to understand the currently-unknown mechanism for heating the Sun's corona. The Solar Wind The hot solar atmosphere, or corona, is expanding into interplanetary space, filling the solar system with a perpetual flow of electrified matter called the solar wind. Unlike any wind on Earth, the solar wind is a rarefied mixture of protons, electrons and magnetic fields, streaming radially outward from the Sun. Thus, the space between the planets is not completely empty, it is filled with charged pieces of the Sun. At increasing distances from the Sun, where the solar gravity weakens, the hot coronal material creates an outward pressure that overcomes the Sun's gravity, creating a wind that accelerates away to supersonic speeds, like water overflowing a dam. And as the corona disperses, it must be replaced by gases welling up from below to feed the eternal solar wind. Spacecraft have made in situ (Latin for in original place", or literally, "in the same place") measurements of the solar wind near the Earth, showing that it manifests itself in two ways, either as wind moving at a relatively slow speed of 300 to 400 kilometres per second, or as high-speed streams of 600 to 800 kilometres per second. What forces propel the solar wind to these supersonic velocities with such tremendous energy, and where do the components of the solar wind come from? The acceleration and origin of the solar wind are not completely known, and are included as principal scientific objectives of the {SOHO} mission. Given the high observed temperatures, the ordinary slow-speed wind is a consequence of its expected outward flow. As this component breaks away from the Sun, it will gain speed with distance, reaching supersonic speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second at a few solar radii from Sun-centre. So, the basic mystery for the acceleration of the slow-speed component is the unknown heat source of the corona. No one really knows how the high-speed stream is accelerated. And where does the solar wind come from? The high-speed component of the solar wind apparently squirts out of extended regions of low density and temperature in the solar corona. These regions, called coronal holes, appear as large dark areas in {EUV} or X-ray images, seemingly devoid of radiation. The magnetism in the coronal holes stretches radially outward, providing a fast lane for the high-speed wind. However, the source of the low-speed wind remains a mystery to be solved by future {SOHO} observations. {SOHO}: from the Sun to the Earth Coronal remote sensing and in-situ experiments on board {SOHO} will provide a comprehensive data set to study the solar wind from its source at the Sun to the Earth. We have already discussed two of them, {UVCS} and {LASCO}, that will determine temperature, density and velocity information in regions near the Sun where the solar wind is accelerated and has its origin (see previous section; {SOHO} Tunes in the Sun's Atmosphere). Three {SOHO} instruments, {CELIAS}, {COSTEP} and {ERNE}, will analyse in situ that charged particles in the solar wind. The Charge, {ELement} and Isotope Analysis System, or {CELIAS}, will measure the mass, ionic charge and energy of the low-speed and high-speed solar wind, as well as energetic particles emitted during explosions on the Sun. {COSTEP} ({COmprehensive} {SupraThermal} and Energetic Particle analyser) and {ERNE} (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron experiment) , together form a collaboration to study the energy release and particle acceleration processes in the solar atmosphere, as well as particle propagation in the interplanetary medium. {COSTEP} will measure energy spectra of electrons (up to 5 {MeV}), protons and helium nuclei (up to 52 {MeV}/nucleus). {ERNE} will measure energy spectra of heavier ions (up to 540 {MeV}/nucleus), abundance rations of isotopes and the anisotropy of the particle flux. The Study of Solar Wind {ANisotropies}, or {SWAN}, will make complete sky maps of the hydrogen density in the solar wind, determining the distribution of the solar wind mass flux from equator to pole as well as the variation of this distribution. Command and control of {SOHO} {ESA} has overall responsibility for the {SOHO} mission, but {NASA} will provide the launch, tracking and control. The spacecraft will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida by Atlas {IIAS}, the most powerful of the Atlas-Centaur rockets. The satellite will maintain contact with the ground through {NASA}'s Deep Space Network ({DSN}). The {DSN} is a network of three radio antennas spread around the world. One is in Goldstone, {USA}, a second near Madrid, Spain, and a third is placed in Canberra, Australia. Together, these antennas provide continuous links to spacecraft wherever thy happen to be in relation to Earth. After the {DSN} has collected the {SOHO} data, it will be routed to {NASA}'s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, {USA}, from where {SOHO} will be commanded. A special facility, known as the {SOHO} Experiment Operations Facility, has been set up at Goddard.. This will serve as the fulcrum for all {SOHO} operation. Scientists will meet there in order to use the spacecraft and to plan the scientific investigations it will be carrying out. The data from all observations will be stored there in an archive and researchers from all over the world will be able to access the information electronically, via computers. Energising Space Near Earth Fortunately for life on Earth, the terrestrial magnetic fields shield us from the full blast of the solar wind, deflecting it away from hr Earth and hollowing out a cavity in it. Yet, this magnetic cocoon, called the magnetosphere, is constantly being buffeted, distorted and reshaped by the variable solar wind, and some of it manages to penetrate the Earth's magnetic defence at its weak points. The Sun thereby feeds a vast and shifting web of energetic particles, electric currents and magnetic fields that encircle the Earth in space. The Sun's gusty solar wind can therefore affect our environment significantly. It can disturb the Earth's magnetic field, producing geomagnetic storms, create the northern and southern lights (the aurora), disrupt navigation and communication systems, destroy electronics, endanger astronauts and create electrical power blackouts on Earth. {SOHO}'s investigations of the acceleration, evolution and origin of the solar wind therefore have a direct impact on human activity. Indeed, all of these effects are of such vital importance that national centres employ space weather forecasters and continuously monitor the Sun from the ground and space to warn of threatening solar activity. The Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme - comprising of {SOHO} and its sister-mission Cluster - are aimed at obtaining a fuller understanding of the vital link between the Sun and the Earth. {SOHO} will look back at the ultimate source of it all, the Sun, in order to identify and analyse the ultimate source of the phenomena that cause terrestrial effects. Cluster will investigate in detail and - being a flotilla of four magnetospheric spacecraft - in three dimensions, the physical mature of the processes that are induced in the near-Earth environment. "All those who have worked tirelessly on the {SOHO} payload, spacecraft and ground segment are to be congratulated in their excellent work and for having developed the most remarkable tool to help us understand the Sun and its environment, the heliosphere", said Roger Bonnet.},

However, observations reveal that about 1\% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the big bang. With only about 150 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishing properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of 2330 low-mass (1–3 M ⊙) lithium-rich giant stars, which we argue are consistent with internal lithium production that is driven by tidal spin-up by a binary companion. Our sample reveals that most lithium-rich giants have helium-burning cores (), and that the frequency of lithium-rich giants rises with increasing stellar metallicity. We find that while planet accretion may explain some lithium-rich giants, it cannot account for the majority that have helium-burning cores. We rule out most other proposed explanations for the origin of lithium-rich giants. Our analysis shows that giants remain lithium-rich for only about two million years. A prediction from this lithium depletion timescale is that most lithium-rich giants with a helium-burning core have a binary companion.},

Other photospheric observations will contribute to our knowledge of the solar magnetic field and surface motions. The investigation consists of coordinated efforts by several teams pursuing specific scientific objectives. The instrument images the Sun on a 10242 {CCD} camera through a series of increasingly narrow spectral filters. The final elements, a pair of tunable Michelson interferometers, enable {MDI} to record filtergrams with a {FWHM} bandwidth of 94 {mÅ}. Normally 20 images centered at 5 wavelengths near the Ni I 6768 spectral line are recorded each minute. {MDI} calculates velocity and continuum intensity from the filtergrams with a resolution of 4″ over the whole disk. An extensive calibration program has verified the end-to-end performance of the instrument. To provide continuous observations of the longest-lived modes that reveal the internal structure of the Sun, a carefully-selected set of spatial averages are computed and downlinked at all times. About half the time {MDI} will also be able to downlink complete velocity and intensity images each minute. This high rate telemetry ({HRT}) coverage is available for at least a continuous 60-day interval each year and for 8 hours each day during the rest of the year. During the 8-hour {HRT} intervals, 10 of the exposures each minute can be programmed for other observations, such as measurements in {MDI}'s higher resolution (1.25″) field centered about 160″ north of the equator; meanwhile, the continuous structure program proceeds during the other half minute. Several times each day, polarizers will be inserted to measure the line-of-sight magnetic field. {MDI} operations will be scheduled well in advance and will vary only during the daily 8-hour campaigns. Quick-look and summary data, including magnetograms, will be processed immediately. Most high-rate data will be delivered only by mail to the {SOI} Science Support Center ({SSSC}) at Stanford, where a processing pipeline will produce 3 Terabytes of calibrated data products each year. These data products will be analyzed using the {SSSC} and the distributed resources of the co-investigators. The data will be available for collaborative investigations.},

	abstract = {We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich {RGB} stars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to determine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the twenty Li-rich giants whose location on the {HR} diagram we were able to determine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the remaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of this fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which occur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We suggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper mixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass {RGB} stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase referred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars, the Li-rich phase occurs on the early-{AGB}. The compiled data provide constraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes suggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific trigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of the Li content of the {ISM} as a result of these episodes is negligible.},

Special emphasis is put into the frequency determination of the p modes, as well as the splitting in the multiplets due to rotation. For both, we show that the improvement in S/N level with respect to the ground-based networks and other experiments is essential in achieving a very low-degree frequency table with small errors ∼ 2 parts in 10-5). On the other hand, the splitting found seems to favour a solar core which does not rotate slower than its surface. The line widths do agree with theoretical expectations and other observations.},

Power spectra of 108 days are compared showing systematic differences between mode frequencies measured in intensity and in velocity. Data coverage exceeds 97\% for all the instruments during this interval. The weighted mean differences (V-I) are -0.1 µHz for l=0, and -0.16 µHz for l=1. The source of this systematic difference may be due to an asymmetry effect that is stronger for modes seen in intensity. Wavelet analysis is also used to compare the shape of the forcing functions.

	abstract = {In this paper we present two new results. The first concerns the proper identification of the critical Richardson number Ri(cr) above which there is no longer turbulent mixing. Thus far, all studies have assumed that: Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) = 1/4. However, since Riell(cr) determines the upper limit of a laminar regime (superscript l), it has little relevance to stars where the problem is not to determine the end point of a laminar regime but the endpoint of turbulence. We show that the latter is characterized by Rit (cr), where t stands for turbulence, and has a value four times larger than (1): Ri (cr) = Rit (cr) ≈ 4 Riell (cr)≈ 1. We also show that use of (2) instead of (1) changes the conclusions of recent studies. Inclusion of radiative losses (characterized by the Peclet number Pe) which weaken stable stratification and help turbulence, further changes (2) to (r stands for radiative): Ri (cr) = Rir (cr) {\textbackslash}textasciitilde (1+Pe)Pe-1 Rit (cr) which, for Pe{\textbackslash}textless1, allows turbulence to survive far longer than (2). Finally, turbulent convection generates gravity waves that propagate into the radiative region and act as an additional source of energy. This further changes Eq. (3) to (gw stands for gravity waves): Ri (cr) = Rigw (cr) =Rir (1+ηgw) where etagw {\textbackslash}textgreater1. In conclusion, the successive inclusion of relevant physical processes leads to a chain of increasing values of Ri (cr): Ri (cr) = Riell (cr) → Rit (cr)→ Riˆr (cr)→ Rigw (cr). The second result concerns the dependence of the diffusivity D on Omega . We show that the commonly used expression Dχ-1{\textbackslash}textasciitilde (Ω/N)2 is not correct for the regime Pe{\textbackslash}textless1 that characterizes a stably stratified regime. The proper Omega -dependence is: Dχ-1{\textbackslash}textasciitilde (Ω/N)4.},

The initial performance of {GOLF} is shown to be within the design specification, for the entire instrument as well as for the separate sub-systems. Malfunctioning of the polarising mechanisms after 3 to 4 months operation has led to the adoption of an unplanned operating sequence in which these mechanisms are no longer used. This mode, which measures only the blue wing of the solar sodium lines, detracts little from the detection and frequency measurements of global oscillations, but does make more difficult the absolute velocity calibration, which is currently of the order of 20\%. Data continuity in the new mode is extremely high and the instrument is producing exceptionally noise-free p-mode spectra. The data set is particularly well suited to the study of effects due to the excitation mechanism of the modes, leading to temporal variations in their amplitudes. The g modes have not yet been detected in this limited data set. In the present mode of operation, there are no indications of any degradation which would limit the use of {GOLF} for up to 6 years or more.},

A dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. It produces a predominantly horizontal field. This dynamo process is found to be more effective in transporting angular momentum than the known hydrodynamic mechanisms. It might account for the observed pattern of rotation in the solar core.},

Our assumptions are considerably less restrictive than those of previous analyses. The angular velocity need not have cylindrical isorotational surfaces, and a priori convective stability is not assumed. In an unmagnetized gas, stability under these circumstances would be governed by the Høland criteria. These criteria change qualitatively when even a weak magnetic field is present. In a magnetized plasma, the new criteria for stability have the same general form exhibited by the purely hydrodynamical case, but with all angular momentum gradients replaced by angular velocity gradients. Our findings are in accord with those of Papaloizou \& Szuszkiewicz, who, using very different methods, considered the stability of isorotational field configurations. The results presented here thus point very generally to angular velocity gradients, not angular momentum gradients, as the fundamental stability discriminants in rotating astrophysical plasmas.},

These data were fitted using an innovative and independent methodology devised a few years ago. The mode fitting was carried out on time series of varying lengths (1×, 2×, 4×, 8×, 16×, 32×, 64 × 72 day-long), using co-eval epochs for all three data sets. By fitting time series of varying lengths, one trades off some temporal resolution for a better precision. We present a comparison of these results, and discuss the potential sources of the residual small discrepancies. We also present inferences from these results on the determination of the solar internal rotation and changes with epoch and thus activity levels.},

	abstract = {Context. Recent numerical simulations suggest that the model by Zahn (1992, A\&A, 265, 115) for the turbulent mixing of chemical elements due to differential rotation in stellar radiative zones is valid. Aims: We investigate the robustness of this result with respect to the numerical configuration and Reynolds number of the flow. Methods: We compare results from simulations performed with two different numerical codes, including one that uses the shearing-box formalism. We also extensively study the dependence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient on the turbulent Reynolds number. Results: The two numerical codes used in this study give consistent results. The turbulent diffusion coefficient is independent of the size of the numerical domain if at least three large turbulent structures fit in the box. Generally, the turbulent diffusion coefficient depends on the turbulent Reynolds number. However, our simulations suggest that an asymptotic regime is obtained when the turbulent Reynolds number is larger than 103. Conclusions: Shear mixing in the regime of small Péclet numbers can be investigated numerically both with shearing-box simulations and simulations using explicit forcing. Our results suggest that Zahn's model is valid at large turbulent Reynolds numbers.},

	abstract = {Grids of models for rotating stars are constructed in the range of 9 to 120 Msun at solar metallicity. The following effects of rotation are included: shellular rotation, new structure equations for non-conservative case, surface distortions, increase of mass loss with rotation, meridional circulation and interaction with horizontal turbulence, shear instability and coupling with thermal effects, advection and diffusion of angular momentum treated in the non-stationary regime, transport and diffusion of the chemical elements. Globally we find that for massive stars the effects of rotation have an importance comparable to those of mass loss. Due to meridional circulation the internal rotation law Omega (r) rapidly converges, in 1-2\% of the {MS} lifetime, towards a near equilibrium profile which then slowly evolves during the {MS} phase. The circulation shows two main cells. In the deep interior, circulation rises along the polar axis and goes down at the equator, while due to the Gratton-Öpik term it is the inverse in outer layers. This external inverse circulation grows in depth as evolution proceeds. We emphasize that a stationary approximation and a diffusive treatment of meridional circulation would be inappropriate. After the {MS} phase, the effects of core contraction and envelope expansion dominate the evolution of the angular momentum. The surface velocities decrease very much during the {MS} evolution of the most massive stars, due to their high mass loss, which also removes a lot of angular momentum. This produces some convergence of the velocities, but not necessarily towards the break-up velocities. However, stars with masses below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 12 Msun with initially high rotation may easily reach the break-up velocities near the end of the {MS} phase, which may explain the occurrence of Be-stars. Some other interesting properties of the rotational velocities are pointed out. For an average rotation, the tracks in the {HR} diagram are modified like a moderate overshoot would do. In general, an average rotation may increase the {MS} lifetime up to about 30\%; for the helium-burning phase the effects are smaller and amount to at most 10\%. From plots of the isochrones, we find that rotation may increase the age estimate by about 25\% in general. However, for stars with M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 40 Msun and fast rotation, a bluewards “homogeneous-like” track, with important He- and N-enrichments, may occur drastically affecting the age estimates for the youngest clusters. Rotation also introduces a large scatter in the mass-luminosity relation: at the same log g\_eff and log T\_eff, differences of masses by 30\% may easily occur, thus explaining what still remains of the alleged mass discrepancy. Rotation also brings significant surface He- and N-enhancements, they are higher for higher masses and rotation. While it is not difficult to explain very fast rotators with He- and N-excesses, the present models also well account for the many {OB} stars exhibiting surface enrichments and moderate or low rotation, (cf. Herrero et al. {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He92\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{He20\}). These stars likely result from initially fast rotators, which experienced mixing and lost a lot of angular momentum due to enhanced mass loss. The comparison of the N-excesses for B- and A-type supergiants supports the conclusion by Venn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{ve95a\}, {\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Ve99\}), that these enrichments mostly result from mixing during the {MS} phase, which is also in agreement with the results of Lyubimkov ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Lyu96\}).},

	abstract = {The {GONG} and {MDI} global helioseismology pipelines provide solar acoustic mode parameters for 108- and 72-day time series respectively by fitting the 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m spectra of a given (n, ℓ/) multiplet either individually ({GONG}) or simultaneously ({MDI}). Our knowledge of the variable solar interior through helioseismic observations derives primarily from these two analysis pipelines. We have developed a new method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting the rotation- and structure-induced frequency shift for each m-spectrum to minimize the mode width in the m-averaged spectrum. The m-averaged spectrum appears to be a powerful tool for low signal-to-noise-ratio modes in the low-frequency range where the modes have very long lifetimes. Indeed, in the case of spatially-resolved helioseismic data ({MDI}, {GONG}, {HMI}), for a given multiplet (n, ℓ/), there exist 2 ℓ + 1 individual-m spectra, which can result in an average spectrum with a {SNR} ≫ 1 even when the individual-m spectra have a {SNR} {\textbackslash}textless 1. We show here that the m-averaged spectrum technique, applied to the {GONG} 108-day and {MDI} 72-day time series, gives us access to a whole new range of predicted, low-{SNR} modes that had not been successfully fitted by the current {MDI} and {GONG} peak-fitting pipelines. We show that the modes that are measured by both techniques are extracted without bias. We apply this technique to 360-, 720-, 1080-, and 1440-day long {GONG} time series to infer the variability of the mode parameters with solar activity in the low-frequency range below {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1500 μHz.},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in constant rotation surfaces, the isorotational contours of the solar convective zone may be reproduced with great fidelity. Even at this early stage of development, this helioseismology fit may be used to put a lower bound on the mid-latitude radial solar entropy gradient, which is in good accord with standard mixing length theory. In this paper, we generalize this solar calculation to fully convective stars (and potentially planets), retaining the assumptions of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in isorotational surfaces. It is found that each isorotation contour is of the form R2 = A + {BΦ}(r), where R is the radius from the rotation axis, Φ(r) is the (assumed spherical) gravitational potential, and A and B are constants along the contour. This result is applied to simple models of fully convective stars. Both solar-like surface rotation profiles (angular velocity decreasing toward the poles) as well as `antisolar' profiles (angular velocity increasing toward the poles) are modelled; the latter bear some suggestive resemblance to numerical simulations. We also perform exploratory studies of zonal surface flows similar to those seen in Jupiter and Saturn. In addition to providing a practical framework for understanding the results of large-scale numerical simulations, our findings may also prove useful in dynamical calculations for which a simple but viable model for the background rotation profile in a convecting fluid is needed. Finally, our work bears directly on an important goal of the {CoRoT} programme: to elucidate the internal structure of rotating, convecting stars.},

	abstract = {Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun greatly expand to become red giant stars. Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core. Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime, which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than 300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex.

The variations have frequencies within a 1.1 {mHz} range centered at 0.9 {mHz}, and a total rms amplitude within that range of 2.5 m/s. Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation, indicating that the variations seen on Procyon are of stellar origin. The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well. In order to clarify the sources of ambiguity in this and similar observations, the data acquisition, reduction, and interpretation are described.},

Here, we present the analysis of data from 10 days observing run carried out in November 1998. We detect significant excess in the power between 0.5-1.5 {mHz} in the periodograms of the time series of mean Doppler shifts. Observations of eta Cas made with the same instrument during the same time interval and in almost identical night conditions show a flat spectrum in this frequency range, indicating that the excess of Doppler signal seen on Procyon is of stellar origin. When data from the whole run are jointly analyzed, a period analysis places an upper limit of 0.50-0.60 ms-1 for the amplitude of oscillations, while the frequency cutoff is around 1.5 {mHz}. The power evidently drops near 0.55 and 1.5 {mHz} on the average of unfiltered power spectra of individual nights, which is consistent with the expected p-mode oscillation properties for Procyon. Several equispaced peaks in frequency are recurrent in the power spectra of two independent segments of 4 and 3 contiguous nights; the most probable frequency spacing seems to be 55 mu Hz. In conclusion, we now have an instrument set-up which is sufficiently stable and fast to be used for a multi-site campaign involving instruments with comparable velocity precisions, to detect the oscillation modes of sun-like stars.

	abstract = {{NASA}'s re-purposed Kepler mission—dubbed K2—has brought new scientific opportunities that were not anticipated for the original Kepler mission. One science goal that makes optimal use of K2's capabilities, in particular its 360{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$ ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology—the study of the evolution of the Galaxy from the fossil stellar record. The thrust of this research is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from K2 in order to detect oscillations in red giant stars. This asteroseismic information can provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass, and age of vast numbers of stars across the Galaxy. Here we present the initial analysis of a subset of red giants, observed toward the north galactic gap, during the mission's first full science campaign. We investigate the feasibility of using K2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparent magnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). We demonstrate that oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the \{log\}g range ∼1.9-3.2. Our detection is complete down to \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{Kp\}\} ∼ 14.5, which results in a seismic sample with little or no detection bias. This sample is ideally suited to stellar population studies that seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary Galaxy models.},

	abstract = {2-D stellar evolution sequences have been calculated to assess the applicability of the assumptions traditionally made in 1-D calculations for the evolution of close binaries. The companion in the 2-D calculations is assumed to be a gravitational point source. These calculations are performed from the {ZAMS} to very close to when mass transfer would begin. We find that the interior properties of the models, such as the time history of the central temperature, central density, and convective core mass are essentially unchanged in the 2-D models from the 1- D results. This is true even though the convective core is not quite spherically symmetric, but slightly elongated in the direction of the companion. We treat the 2-D model surface as an equipotential. The surface matches that of a Roche potential closely until the elongation toward the companion is close to that required for mass transfer. Moreover, the surface evolution as Roche lobe overflow is approached becomes so rapid that the surface may not be able to adjust sufficiently fast to remain an equipotential. We conclude the 1-D approach is satisfactory through the events covered by our calculations except possibly just before mass transfer begins.},

	abstract = {For this invited contribution, I was asked to give an overview about the application of helio and aster-oseismic techniques to study the interior of giant planets, and to specifically present the recent observations of Neptune by Kepler K2. Seismology applied to giant planets could drastically change our understanding of their deep interiors, as it has happened with the Earth, the Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved stars. The study of giant planets' composition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their formation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own. Unfortunately, its determination is complicated by the fact that their interior is thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a whole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely on indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid and convective, which makes their seismology much closer to that of solar-like stars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology techniques naturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can be used: photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and ring seismology in the specific case of Saturn. The current decade has been promising thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic oscillations with the ground-based imaging-spectrometer {SYMPA} and indirect detection of Saturn's f-modes in its rings by the {NASA} Cassini orbiter. This has motivated new projects of ground-based and space-borne instruments that are under development. The K2 observations represented the first opportunity to search for planetary oscillations with visible photometry. Despite the excellent quality of K2 data, the noise level of the power spectrum of the light curve was not low enough to detect Neptune's oscillations. The main results from the K2 observations are the clear detection of the well-known differential rotation of Neptune, measured for the first time through the rotational modulation of its photometry, and the detection of the Sun's oscillations, for the first time in an indirect way in intensity measurements.},

Our knowledge and understanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in the data.

The limit of slow rotation recovers Eddington-Sweet theory, whereas it is shown that in the limit of rapid rotation the system settles into a geostrophic equilibrium.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to improve the modelization of the rotational mixing which occurs in stellar radiation zones, through the combined action of the thermally driven meridional circulation and of the turbulence generated by the shear of differential rotation. The turbulence is assumed to be anisotropic, due to the stratification, with stronger transport in the horizontal directions than in the vertical. The main difference with the former treatments by Zahn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Zahn1992\}, A\&A, 265, 115) and Maeder \& Zahn ({\textbackslash}textbackslashcite\{Maeder1998\}, A\&A, 334, 1000) is that we expand here the departures from spherical symmetry to higher order, and include explicitly the differential rotation in latitude, to first order. This allows us to treat simultaneously the bulk of a radiation zone and its tachocline(s). Moreover, we take fully into account the non-stationarity of the problem, which will enable us to tackle the rapid phases of evolution. The system of partial differential equations, which govern the transport of angular momentum, heat and chemical elements, is written in a form which makes it ready to implement in a stellar evolution code. Here the effect of a magnetic field is deliberately ignored; it will be included in forthcoming papers. Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.edpsciences.org},

Its phase is measured and translated directly into velocity with an absolute calibration, providing a sensitive measurement of the Doppler signal. This paper reports the 4.5 nights observation of Procyon in February 1998 with this instrumentation. The final 1-sigma noise of the spectrum beyond 0.8 {mHz} is as low as 0.12 m s(-1{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}.{muHz} (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}-1/2)) . Even with this noise level, in a single site observation we cannot report a firm detection of p-modes. We do not detect any significant excess in the power spectrum near 1 {mHz}. A limit on the amplitude of the modes can be deduced, which cannot exceed 1 m s(-1) . However, the “comb response” exhibits the signature of a possible regular pattern with a large splitting nu\_0 of 53 mu Hz, which would indicate that a signal of stellar origin has been detected. Both values agree with theoretical predictions, but are in contradiction with claimed detection of p-modes previously reported.},

We have conducted extensive 3–D simulations of compressible convection in rotating spherical shells with and without magnetic fields, to study the coupling between global-scale convection and rotation in seeking to understand how the solar differential rotation is established and maintained. Such simulations capable of studying fairly turbulent convection have been enabled by massively parallel supercomputers.

A high degree of coherent structures involving downflowing plumes can be embedded in otherwise chaotic flow fields. These vortical structures play a significant role in yielding Reynolds stresses that serve to redistribute angular momentum, leading to differential rotation profiles with pole-to-equator contrasts of about 30\% in angular velocity, Omega, and some constancy along radial lines at mid latitudes, thereby making good contact with deductions from helioseismology. When a magnetic field is introduced, a dynamo regime can be found that does not destroy the strong differential rotation achieved in pure hydrodynamics cases.

The sequence of models for each mass might be regarded as having one small, one moderate, and two fairly rapid rotations. The convective core rotation law and overshooting are determined by two-dimensional, fully implicit hydrodynamic calculations. All models exhibit convective core overshooting. The slowly rotating models show primarily radial convective motion, while the instantaneous flow patterns of the more rapidly rotating models show that the motion is primarily parallel to the rotation axis. The resulting core rotation rate may be fitted by a power law in the distance from the rotation axis, with a cutoff at small distances from the axis, at least for the moderately and rapidly rotating models. The rotation law in the radiative region external to the convective core was chosen to be uniform for the first models calculated, but some models with negative power laws were constructed. These showed that the power law could not be too steep, or the model developed a density inversion near the rotation axis because the pressure gradient must essentially balance the rotational variation, since the gradient of the gravitational potential is too shallow to aid significantly in the balance.},

Methods: The potentials of the two distorted components can be approximated to 2nd-degree harmonics. Furthermore, both the accretion luminosity (σi) and the irradiative luminosity are included in stellar structure equations. Results: The equilibrium structure of rotationally and tidally distorted star is exactly a triaxial ellipsoids. A formula describing the isobars is presented, and the rotational velocity and the gravitational acceleration at the primary surface simulated. The results show the distortion at the outer layers of the primary increases with temporal variation and system evolution. Besides, it was observed that the luminosity accretion is unstable, and the curve of the energy-generation rate fluctuates after the main sequence in rotation sequences. The luminosity in rotation sequences is slightly weaker than that in non-rotation sequences. As a result, the volume expands slowly. Polar ejection is intensified by the tidal effect. The ejection of an equatorial ring may be favoured by both the opacity effect and the g\_e(θ,{\textbackslash}textbackslashvarphi)-effect in the binary system.},

The observed wind terminal velocities are used with the analytic approximation for the theory of radiatively driven winds (Kudritzki et al., 1989) to obtain masses and mass loss rates. The masses derived from the spectroscopic analysis and those derived independently from the wind theory agree, except for a small difference attributed to deficiencies in the physics of the model atmospheres used.

We show that while the fundamental stellar parameters do not depend on the treatment of convection adopted (Mixing Length Theory - {MLT} - or “Full Spectrum of Turbulence” - {FST}), the age of the system depends on the inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the small frequency separation of component B. We try to answer the question of the universality of the mixing length parameter, and we find a statistically reliable dependence of the α-parameter on the {HR} diagram location (with a trend similar to the predictions based on 2-D simulations). We propose the frequency separation ratios as better observables to determine the fundamental stellar parameters, and to use the large frequency separation and frequencies to extract information about the stellar structure. The effects of diffusion and equation of state on the oscillation frequencies are also studied, but present seismic data do not allow their determination.},

Equivalent widths of generally weak lines are obtained using high-signal-to-noise Reticon spectra of 39 stars in four spectral regions. Effective temperatures and gravities for these stars are derived. Projected rotational velocities are measured using a cross-correlation technique. Abundances are derived using {LTE} methods and non-{LTE} equivalent width calculations.

No compelling evidence for a systematic increase in N abundance with evolutonary age was found; thus Liubimkov's claim that mixing occurs generally in main-sequence B stars cannot be confirmed.},

By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power (νmax) and the large frequency separation (Δν). We find excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 4\%. We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean deviations for stars between T eff = 4600-6200 K of -22 {\textbackslash}pm 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 {\textbackslash}pm 31 K (with a scatter of 93 K), respectively. Finally, we present a first comparison with evolutionary models, and find differences between observed and theoretical properties for the metal-rich main-sequence star {HD} 173701. We conclude that the constraints presented in this study will have strong potential for testing stellar model physics, in particular when combined with detailed modeling of individual oscillation frequencies.},

These abundance variations can be observed spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient {GCs}, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the {GC} population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

We distributed tens of individual oscillation frequencies extracted from the time series of each star among seven modeling teams who applied different methods to determine radii, masses, and ages for all stars in the sample. Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of ∼2\% in radius, ∼4\% in mass, and ∼10\% in age, making this the best-characterized sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences from chemical enrichment laws ΔY/ΔZ and predictions from 3D atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements, Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs {LEGACY} sample, these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic properties available for at least another decade.

In this work we systematically characterize solar-like oscillations and granulation for 16,094 oscillating red giants, using end-of-mission long-cadence data. We produced a homogeneous catalog of the frequency of maximum power (typical uncertainty \{σ \}\{ν {\textbackslash}textbackslashmax \}=1.6 \% ), the mean large frequency separation (\{σ \}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}Δ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}ν {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=0.6 \% ), oscillation amplitude (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}\{\{A\}\}=4.7 \% ), granulation power (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}gran{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=8.6 \% ), power excess width (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}width{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}=8.8 \% ), seismically derived stellar mass (\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}\{\{M\}\}=7.8 \% ), radius (\{σ \}\{\{R\}\}=2.9 \% ), and thus surface gravity (\{σ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}logg\}=0.01 dex). Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch ({RGB}) and helium-core-burning ({HeB}) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed \{ν \}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmax , which might hold clues for understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as {APOGEE} and {LAMOST}.},

Due to their high scientific value, in particular for Galaxy population studies and stellar structure and evolution, their Kepler light curves were made public in late 2011. More than 13,000 (over 85\%) of these stars show intrinsic flux variability caused by solar-like oscillations making them ideal for large-scale asteroseismic investigations. We automatically extracted individual frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipole modes in nearly every red giant. These measurements naturally classify the stars into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass (M/M ⊙ {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1.8) helium-core-burning red clump, and the higher-mass (M/M ⊙ {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1.8) secondary clump. The period spacings also reveal that a large fraction of the stars show rotationally induced frequency splittings. This sample of stars will undoubtedly provide an extremely valuable source for studying the stellar population in the direction of the Kepler field, in particular when combined with complementary spectroscopic surveys.},

	abstract = {Methods. We used asteroseismic rotational inversions to probe the internal stellar rotation profiles in red-giant models from the base of the red-giant branch up to the luminosity bump. We used the inversion method of multiplicative optimally localised averages to assess how well internal and surface rotation rates can be recovered from different mode sets and different synthetic rotation profiles. Results. We confirm that dipole mixed modes are sufficient to set constraints on the average core-rotation rates in red giants. However, surface-rotation rates estimated with only dipole mixed modes are contaminated by the core rotation. We show that the sensitivity to surface rotation decreases from the base of the red-giant branch until it reaches a minimum at 60–80\% of the bump luminosity due to a glitch in the buoyancy frequency. Thereafter, a narrow range of increased surface sensitivity just below the bump luminosity exists. Quadrupole and octopole modes have more sensitivity in the outer parts of the star. To obtain accurate estimates of rotation rates at intermediate radii (i.e. a fractional radius of ∼0.4), acoustic oscillation modes with a spherical degree of l ≈ 10 are needed. Conclusions. We find a minimum and subsequent maximum in the sensitivity to the surface rotation rate in red giants below the luminosity bump. Furthermore, we show that, if observed, quadrupole and octopole modes enable us to distinguish between differential and solid body rotation in the convection zone. This will be important when investigating the transport of angular momentum between the core and the envelope.},

Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields generated by the differential rotation. We present the first stellar evolution calculations to follow the evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic, from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to become a neutron star is an increasing function of main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more important role in the star's explosion. The final angular momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially by fallback, are explored.},

Using the observed frequencies of solar oscillations it is found that the sound speed and density in a solar model with gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements is very close to that in the Sun, the maximum difference being 0.5\% for the sound speed and 1.5\% for density. It is possible to use this technique to obtain the adiabatic index \{{GAMMA}\}\_1\_ inside the Sun, which can be employed as a probe for the equation of state in stellar interiors. The relative sound speed difference between the reference solar model and the Sun just below the He ii ionization zone indicates that the adiabatic index of the solar material in this region is smaller than that in the model.

There is currently little consensus on the most appropriate 1D models of semi-convection and overshooting convection, so we have implemented the physically-motivated semi-convection prescriptions from Wood, Garaud, \& Stellmach (2013) and Moll, Garaud, \& Stellmach (in preparation) and overshooting convection prescription from Rempel (2004) into {KEPLER}.

The technique chosen for inverting the solar oscillation data was the discretized least-squares technique.

The evolutionary tracks from the models are examined in the light of observational data. Calculations of 15- and 20-solar-mass sequences show that - regardless of the combination of semiconvective and overshooting efficiency - no blue-supergiant phase is predicted. It is concluded that all models including the present ones erroneously predict a post-main-sequence gap.

	abstract = {The von Zeipel theorem is generalised to account for differential rotation in the case of a “shellular” rotation law (cf. Zahn 1992). We write this law in the form Omega = Omega (r), a simplification which does not apply to fast rotation. We find that von Zeipel's relation contains a small additional term, generally further increasing the radiative flux at the pole and decreasing it at the equator. We also examine the local Eddington factor in rotating stars and notice some significant differences with respect to current expressions. We examine the latitudinal dependence of the mass loss rates dot \{M\} (vartheta ) in rotating stars and find two main source of wind anisotropies: 1) the “geff” effect which enhances the polar ejection; 2) the “opacity effect” (or “kappa -effect”), which favours equatorial ejection. In O-stars the geff effect is expected to largely dominate. In B- and later type stars the opacity effect should favour equatorial ejection and the formation of equatorial rings. We also examine the behaviour of the wind density and notice a strong enhancement at the equator of B- and later type stars. Possible relations with the polar ejections and the skirt of eta Carinae and with the inner and outer rings of {SN} 1987 A are mentioned. If dot \{M\} (vartheta ) has sharp extrema due to some peaks in the opacity law, non equatorial and symmetrical rings may be produced. We also show that the global mass loss rate of a star at a given location in the {HR} diagram is rapidly increasing with rotation, which is in good agreement with the numerical models by Friend \& Abbott (1986). Anisotropic stellar winds remove selectively the angular momentum. For example, winds passing through polar caps in O-stars remove very little angular momentum, an excess of angular momentum is thus retained and rapidly redistributed by horizontal turbulence. These excesses may lead some Wolf-Rayet stars, those resulting directly from O-stars, to be fast spinning objects, while we predict that the {WR}-stars which have passed through the red supergiant phase will have lower rotation velocities on the average. We also show how anisotropic ejection can be treated in numerical models by properly modifying the outer boundary conditions for the transport of angular momentum. Finally, in an Appendix the equation of the surface for stars with shellular rotation is discussed.},

	abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn \& Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60Msun\_ with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}) increases from 0 to 90\% of the surface critical velocity (\{{OMEGA}\}\_crit\_), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60Msun\_) are increased by 1 to 2\%. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5Msun\_ smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the μ-gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of μ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing in-operant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.},

We show that the protostellar pairs, which form from turbulent fragmentation within a single parent core, have randomly oriented angular momentum. Although the pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially misaligned. We produce 12CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations and characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The {CO}-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also statistically consistent with the observed distribution of molecular outflows. We conclude that the observed misalignment provides a clear signature of binary formation via turbulent fragmentation. The persistence of misaligned outflows and stellar spins following dynamical evolution may provide a signature of binary origins for more evolved multiple star systems.},

We find a close alignment between the sky projections of the rotational and orbital angular momentum vectors for both stars (βp = -1.{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$8 {\textbackslash}pm 1.{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$6 and {\textbackslash}textbarβs{\textbackslash}textbar {\textbackslash}textless 17{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$). We also derive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages for this system. The {EP} Cru and {DI} Her systems provide an interesting comparison: they have similar stellar types and orbital properties, but {DI} Her is younger and has major spin-orbit misalignments, raising the question of whether {EP} Cru also had a large misalignment at an earlier phase of evolution. We show that tidal dissipation is an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, because realignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, and the stars in {EP} Cru are far from synchronization (they are spinning nine times too quickly). Therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, while other superficially similar binaries are formed with misaligned axes. Based on observations made with {ESOs} 2.2 m Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program {ID} 084.C-1008 (12.5\%) and under {MPIA} guaranteed time (87.5\%).},

Here we analyze a sample of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations as part of the Kepler seismic {LEGACY} project. We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo “peak-bagging” approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}Δ {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}ν and δ \{ν \}02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \{ν \}{\textbackslash}textbackslashmax with \{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

The observed precession rate is a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that once was interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity. Among the contemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet and a large tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit. Here we report that both stars of {DI} Herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicular to the orbital axis (contrary to the usual assumption for close binary stars).

Aims: We want to reproduce the observed rotation profile of the early red giant {KIC} 7341231 through modeling and constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. Methods: We computed models of {KIC} 7341231 including a treatment of shellular rotation, and we compared the rotation profiles obtained with the one derived from observations. We then modify some modeling parameters in order to quantify their effect on the obtained rotation profile. Moreover, we mimicked a powerful angular momentum transport during the main sequence and studied its effect on the evolution of the rotation profile during the subgiant and red giant phases. Results: We show that meridional circulation and shear mixing alone produce a rotation profile for {KIC} 7341231 that is too steep compared to the observed one. An additional mechanism is then needed to increase the internal transport of angular momentum. We find that this undetermined mechanism has to be efficient not only during the main sequence but also during the much quicker subgiant phase. Moreover, we point out the importance of studying the whole rotational history of a star to explain its rotation profile during the red giant evolution.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology and asteroseismology of red giant stars have shown that the distribution of angular momentum in stellar interiors, and its evolution with time remains an open issue in stellar physics. Owing to the unprecedented quality of Kepler photometry, we are able to seismically infer internal rotation rates in {\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma Doradus stars, which provide the {MS} counterpart to the red-giants puzzle. We confront these internal rotation rates to stellar evolution models with rotationally induced transport of angular momentum, in order to test angular momentum transport mechanisms. We used a stellar model-independent method developed by Christophe et al. in order to obtain seismically inferred, buoyancy radii and near-core rotation for 37 {\textbackslash}textbackslashgamma Doradus stars observed by Kepler. We show that the buoyancy radius can be used as a reliable evolution indicator for field stars on the {MS}. We computed rotating evolutionary models including transport of angular momentum in radiative zones, following Zahn and Maeder, with the {CESTAM} code. This code calculates the rotational history of stars from the birth line to the tip of the {RGB}. The initial angular momentum content has to be set initially, which is done by fitting rotation periods in young stellar clusters. We show a clear disagreement between the near-core rotation rates measured in the sample and the rotation rates obtained from evolutionary models including rotationally induced transport following Zahn (1992). These results show a disagreement similar to that of the Sun and red giant stars. This suggests the existence of missing mechanisms responsible for the braking of the core before and along the {MS}. The efficiency of the missing mechanisms is investigated. The transport of angular momentum as formalized by Zahn and Maeder cannot explain the measurements of near-core rotation in main-sequence intermediate-mass stars we have at hand.},

The Kepler satellite has observed a few dozen red giants with depressed dipole modes, which we interpret as stars with strongly magnetized cores.

Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly {\textbackslash}textasciitilde50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing {\textbackslash}textasciitilde100 to 300 seconds).},

	abstract = {Context. There are now more than 22 months of long-cadence data available for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in their oscillation spectra and see many components of the mixed modes that probe the stellar core. Aims: We report for the first time a parametric fit to the pattern of the ℓ = 1 mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated mixed modes. With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. Methods: We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period échelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. Results: The asymptotic relation for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of ℓ = 3 modes, of ℓ = 2 mixed modes, for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the ℓ = 1 rotational splittings. Conclusions: The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the mean large separation.

	abstract = {Core rotation rates have been measured for red giant stars using asteroseismology. These data, along with helioseismic measurements and open cluster spin-down studies, provide powerful clues about the nature and timescale for internal angular momentum transport in stars. We focus on two cases: the metal-poor red giant {KIC} 7341231 ("Otto") and intermediate-mass core helium burning stars. For both, we examine limiting case studies for angular momentum coupling between cores and envelopes under the assumption of rigid rotation on the main sequence. We discuss the expected pattern of core rotation as a function of mass and radius. In the case of Otto, strong post-main-sequence coupling is ruled out and the measured core rotation rate is in the range of 23-33 times the surface value expected from standard spin-down models. The minimum coupling timescale (0.17-0.45 Gyr) is significantly longer than that inferred for young open cluster stars. This implies ineffective internal angular momentum transport in early first ascent giants. By contrast, the core rotation rates of evolved secondary clump stars are found to be consistent with strong coupling given their rapid main-sequence rotation. An extrapolation to the white dwarf regime predicts rotation periods between 330 and 0.0052 days, depending on mass and decoupling time. We identify two key ingredients that explain these features: the presence of a convective core and inefficient angular momentum transport in the presence of larger mean molecular weight gradients. Observational tests that can disentangle these effects are discussed.},

	abstract = {Context. We still do not understand which physical mechanisms are responsible for the transport of angular momentum inside stars. The recent detection of mixed modes that contain the clear signature of rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and red giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this question. Aims: Our aim is to probe the radial dependence of the rotation profiles for a sample of Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants are particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are more sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case for their more evolved counterparts. Methods: We first extracted the rotational splittings and frequencies of the modes for six young Kepler red giants. We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted the internal rotation profiles of the six stars. Results: We obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that contract from those that expand. Conclusions: We characterized the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant branches.

	abstract = {Context. While rotation has a major impact on stellar structure and evolution, its effects are not well understood. Thanks to high-quality and long-time base photometric observations obtained with recent space missions, we are now able to study stellar rotation more precisely. Aims: We aim to constrain radial differential rotation profiles in γ Doradus (γ Dor) stars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with rapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods: We have derived a new asymptotic description which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core rotation on gravity-mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are illustrated from pulsation computations with the code {GYRE} and compared with observations of γ Dor stars. When possible, we also derived the surface rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of rotational modulation, and computed the core-to-surface rotation ratios. Results: Stellar rotation must be strongly differential before its effects on period spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing patterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained period spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai modes. Finally, we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the photometric data of eight targets. Conclusions: If only one period spacing pattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate is known as well. This is the case for eight of the stars in our sample, revealing surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95 and 1.05.},

Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior.},

It is found that the difference between the surface rotation rate and the average rotation rate (excluding the convective core) of most of stars is small enough to suggest that an efficient process of angular momentum transport operates during and/or before the main-sequence stage of stars.

The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars.

Weak magnetic fields, if present in stellar interiors, are likely to maintain approximately uniform rotation in stars, both on the main sequence and on the giant branches. The nearly uniform rotation of the core of the Sun is evidence for the existence of such fields. Exactly axisymmetric mass loss on the {AGB} from uniformly rotating stars would lead lead to white dwarfs with very long rotation periods ({\textbackslash}textgreater 10 yr). Small random non-axisymmetries ( {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 10(-3) ) in the mass loss process, on the other hand, add sufficient angular momentum to explain the observed rotation periods around one day. The process illustrated with a computation of the probability distribution of the rotation periods under the combined influence of random forcing by weak nonaxisymmetries and angular momentum loss in the {AGB} superwind. Such asymmetries can in principle be observed by proper motion studies of the clumps in interferometric images of {SiO} maser emission.},

The {CoRoT} 5-month long observation runs provide us with the opportunity to analyze a large variety of red-giant stars and derive their fundamental parameters from their asteroseismic properties. Aims: We perform an analysis of more than 4600 {CoRoT} light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of both the star sample and the method to ensure that our asteroseismic results are as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants in two opposite regions of the Galaxy. Methods: We analyze the time series using the envelope autocorrelation function to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean wide frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of the maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius. Results: We identify more than 1800 red giants among the 4600 light curves and obtain accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We are able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We derive precise information about the stellar population distribution and the red clump. By comparing the stars observed in two different fields, we find that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but that the characteristics are different for red-clump stars.

The average space velocity of their progenitor stars is less than 15kms-1, which means that pulsars must receive a substantial `kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform rotation until10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has 1,000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of pulsars. The specific physical process that `kicks' the neutron star at birth has not been identified, but unless its force is exerted exactly head-on it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks may cause a correlation between the velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are born with periods longer than 2s, and never become radio pulsars.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are enjoying a growing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with the {CoRoT} and Kepler missions. In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum (νmax) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off frequency (νc). Using the {SoHO} {GOLF} observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between νmax and νc, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.},

	abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations δL/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy (δL/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be δL/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., α Cen A and β Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

The large number of stars for which uninterrupted high-precision photometric timeseries data are being collected with Kepler and {CoRoT} initiated the development of automated methods to analyse the stochastically excited oscillations in main-sequence, subgiant and red-giant stars. Aims: We investigate the differences in results for global oscillation parameters of G and K red-giant stars due to different methods and definitions. We also investigate uncertainties originating from the stochastic nature of the oscillations. Methods: For this investigation we use Kepler data obtained during the first four months of operation. These data have been analysed by different groups using already published methods and the results are compared. We also performed simulations to investigate the uncertainty on the resulting parameters due to different realizations of the stochastic signal. Results: We obtain results for the frequency of maximum oscillation power (ν\_max) and the mean large separation ({\textbackslash}{textlessΔν}{\textbackslash}textgreater) from different methods for over one thousand red-giant stars. The results for these parameters agree within a few percent and seem therefore robust to the different analysis methods and definitions used here. The uncertainties for ν\_max and {\textbackslash}{textlessΔν}{\textbackslash}textgreater due to differences in realization noise are not negligible and should be taken into account when using these results for stellar modelling.

Convection and Eddington circulation are found to be the most important mechanisms for changing the angular-momentum distribution, while the dynamical shear and Solberg-Hoiland instabilities produce chemical mixing in regions which remain unmixed in nonrotating calculations. The calculations indicate that ignoring the finite time scales associated with angular-momentum redistribution is a poor and often misleading approximation. The primary results are: (1) evolved stellar cores develop nonaxisymmetric instabilities corresponding to the bifurcation of the Maclaurin sequence before they reach critical (Keplerian) rotational velocities; (2) for the 7-solar-mass star, the instability point is reached prior to carbon ignition, indicating that catastrophic carbon detonation may be avoided by rotating stars; and (3) the hydrodynamic events associated with violent stellar death will generally involve rapidly rotating, triaxial, or fissioning cores. In addition to radically altering the nature of these events, this indicates that stellar collapse may be a strong source of gravitational-wave radiation.},

We show that the difference of the Δν-νmax relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M) s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

However, as the core contracts during later stages, important effects arise in all physically plausible cases.

The distributions of νmax and Δν are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a secondary clump population characterized by M {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 2 M sun and νmax {\textbackslash}textasciitilde= 40-110 μHz. We measured the small frequency separations δν02 and δν01 in over 400 stars and δν03 in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation ratios δν02/Δν and δν01/Δν have opposite trends as a function of Δν. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward lower νmax, in agreement with models predicting more efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset epsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with Δν, demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first amplitude-νmax relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a lack of low-amplitude stars for νmax {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 110 μHz and find that, for a given νmax between 40 and 110 μHz, stars with lower Δν (and consequently higher mass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher Δν.},

	abstract = {By considering stellar models with the same interior structure but different outer layers we demonstrate that the ratio of the small to large separations of acoustic oscillations in solar-like stars is essentially independent of the structure of the outer layers, and is determined solely by the interior structure. Defining the scaled Eulerian pressure perturbation psil (omega ,t) = r p' /(rho c)1/2 we define the internal phase shift deltal (omega ,t) through the relation omega psi /(dpsi /dt)=tan (omega t -pil /2 + deltal ). The deltal are almost independent of acoustic radius t=int dr/c outside the stellar core and can be determined as a continuous functions of omega from partial wave solutions for the interior - that is solutions of the oscillation equations for any omega that satisfy the Laplace boundary condition at a sufficiently large acoustic radius tf outside the stellar core. If the omega are eigenfrequencies then they satisfy the Eigenfrequency Equation omega T=(n+l/2) pi +alpha (omega )-deltal (omega ) where alpha (omega ) is the l independent surface phase shift (Roxburgh \& Vorontsov 2000). Using this result we show that the ratio of small to large separations is determined to high accuracy solely by the internal phase shifts deltal (omega ) and hence by the interior structure alone.

These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and {CoRoT} space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

	abstract = {We report the first asteroseismic results obtained with the Hertzsprung Stellar Observations Network Group Telescope from an extensive high-precision radial-velocity observing campaign of the subgiant μ Herculis. The data set was collected during 215 nights in 2014 and 2015. We detected a total of 49 oscillation modes with l values from zero to three, including some l = 1 mixed modes. Based on the rotational splitting observed in l = 1 modes, we determine a rotational period of 52 days and a stellar inclination angle of 63{\textbackslash},$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$. The parameters obtained through modeling of the observed oscillation frequencies agree very well with independent observations and imply a stellar mass between 1.11 and 1.15 M ⊙ and an age of \{7.8\}-0.4+0.3 Gyr. Furthermore, the high-quality data allowed us to determine the acoustic depths of the He {II} ionization layer and the base of the convection zone. Based on observations made with the Hertzsprung {SONG} telescope operated on the Spanish Observatorio del Teide on the island of Tenerife by the Aarhus and Copenhagen Universities and by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias.},

	abstract = {Context. The signatures of nonlinear effects affecting stellar oscillations are difficult to observe from ground observatories because of the lack of continuous high-precision photometric data spanning extended enough time baselines. The unprecedented photometric quality and coverage provided by the Kepler spacecraft offers new opportunities to search for these phenomena. Aims: We use the Kepler data accumulated on the pulsating {DB} white dwarf {KIC} 08626021 to explore in detail the stability of its oscillation modes, searching, in particular, for evidence of nonlinear behaviors. Methods: We analyze nearly two years of uninterrupted short-cadence data, concentrating on identified triplets that are caused by stellar rotation and that show intriguing behaviors during the course of the observations. Results: We find clear signatures of nonlinear effects that could be attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. These couplings occur between the components of the triplets and can induce different types of behaviors. We first notice that a structure at 3681 μHz, identified as a triplet in previous published studies, is in fact forming a doublet, with the third component being an independent mode. We find that a triplet at 4310 μHz and this doublet at 3681 μHz (most likely the two visible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear periodic frequency and amplitude modulations, which are typical of the so-called intermediate regime of the resonance, with timescales consistent with theoretical expectations. Another triplet at 5073 μHz is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the amplitudes are modulated while the frequencies are locked. Using nonadiabatic pulsation calculations, based on a model representative of {KIC} 08626021 to evaluate the linear growth rates of the modes in the triplets, we also provide quantitative information that could be useful for future comparisons with numerical solutions of the amplitude equations. Conclusions: The observed modulations are the clearest hints of nonlinear resonant couplings occurring in white dwarf stars identified so far. These should resonate as a warning to projects that aim at measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of {KIC} 08626021, and of white dwarf stars in general. Nonlinear modulations of the frequencies can potentially jeopardize any attempt to measure such rates reliably, unless they can be corrected beforehand. These results should motivate further theoretical work to develop the nonlinear stellar pulsation theory.},

By modeling the expected transits of all confirmed and candidate planets detected by Kepler as expected to be observed by {TESS}, we provide a probabilistic forecast of the detection of each Kepler planet in {TESS} data. We find that {TESS} has a greater than 50\% chance of detecting 260 of these planets at the 3σ level in one sector of observations and an additional 120 planets in two sectors. Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only ∼5\% of known multiply transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect {TESS} to be a powerful tool to characterize transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 ({KOI}-142) as an example, we show that {TESS} will improve measurements of planet–star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Because {TESS} will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether {TESS} will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems. We find two confirmed planetary systems (Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b) and five candidate systems that will be good candidates to detect tidal decay.},

Many stars besides the Sun may also be amenable to asteroseismic analysis. Stars of roughly solar type should of course behave in ways similar to the sun, and stars of this sort form a large fraction of the potential targets for asteroseismology. But several other types of stars (delta scuti stars, {roAP} stars, and the pulsating white dwarfs) also have the desired pulsation characteristics. Pulsations in some of these stars are, for various reasons, much easier to observe than in the Sun-like stars. Virtually all unambiguous observations of multi-mode pulsators relate to these other categories of stars. Since oscillation mode frequencies are arguably the most precise measurement relating to a star that we can make, a few tens of such frequencies may still be of great importance to our understanding of the stellar structure and evolution.},

It is found that standard solar models are apparently a good approximation to the gross structure of the sun.

We show that some such sets G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] of measurements determine the structure of the Earth within certain limits of error except for fine-scale detail. That is, from some sets G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] it is possible to compute localized averages of the Earth structure at various depths. These localized averages will be slightly in error, and their errors will be larger as their resolving lengths are shortened. We show how to determine whether a given set G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] of measured gross Earth data permits such a construction of localized averages, and, if so, how to find the shortest length scale over which G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] gives a local average structure at a particular depth if the variance of the error in computing that local average from G[Note: See the image of page 124 for this formatted text] is to be less than a specified amount.

	abstract = {A common method to infer that solar properties vary with position is to compare linear estimates of averages of those properties centered at different locations. If some of the confidence intervals for the averages do not overlap, one concludes that the property varies. In order for this conclusion to be statistically valid, the lengths of the intervals must be adjusted to obtain the correct "simultaneous coverage probability." We illustrate the notion of simultaneous coverage probability using coin tossing as an example. We present four methods for adjusting the lengths of confidence intervals for linear estimates, and a complementary approach to infer changes based on constructing a linear estimator that is directly sensitive to changes. The first method for constructing simultaneous confidence intervals is based on Bonferroni's inequality, and applies generally to confidence intervals for any set of parameters, from dependent or independent observations. The second method is based on a 2 measure of fit to the data, which allows one to compute s1multaneous confidence intervals for any number of linear functionals of the model. The third method uses a ˆ\{{\textbackslash}vphantom\}2 {\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}distribution in the space of estimates, which yields "Scheffe'" confidence intervals for the functionals. The fourth method, which produces the shortest confidence intervals, uses the infinity-norm in the space of estimates to construct "maximum-modulus" confidence intervals. We apply the four methods to search for radial changes in averages of solar angular velocity, using data from Big Bear Solar Observatory ({BBSO}) averaged for the 4 yr 1986, 1988-1990. Finally, we apply the new differencing estimator to the {BBSO} data, finding strong evidence that the average solar angular velocity is lower near the poles than near the equator over a range of depths, as is observed at the surface as well.},

This allows great versatility in the choice of target form, and furthermore {SOLA} has the significant advantage of being computationally more efficient than the usual {OLA} formulations. A Gaussian target function is a useful choice, and we use the example of determining the Sun's internal rotation to explore how the parameter values (such as the Gaussian's width) should best be chosen. Some alternatives to using a Gaussian function as target function are discussed and applied to artificial data in a blind experiment. In particular we show that it is possible to invert directly for the gradient of the rotation. This may be of interest if there are localized large gradients in the rotation rate.},

	abstract = {We introduce a variational inference framework for training the Gaussian process latent variable model and thus performing Bayesian nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This method allows us to variationally integrate out the input variables of the Gaussian process and compute a lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood of the nonlinear latent variable model. The maximization of the variational lower bound provides a Bayesian training procedure that is robust to overfitting and can automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. We demonstrate our method on real world datasets. The focus in this paper is on dimensionality reduction problems, but the methodology is more general. For example, our algorithm is immediately applicable for training Gaussian process models in the presence of missing or uncertain inputs.},

Some of the most significant advances have been in the field of asteroseismology, the study of stars by observation of their oscillations. Asteroseismic Data Analysis gives a comprehensive technical introduction to this discipline. This book not only helps students and researchers learn about asteroseismology; it also serves as an essential instruction manual for those entering the field.The book presents readers with the foundational techniques used in the analysis and interpretation of asteroseismic data on cool stars that show solar-like oscillations. The techniques have been refined, and in some cases developed, to analyze asteroseismic data collected by the {NASA} Kepler mission. Topics range from the analysis of time-series observations to extract seismic data for stars to the use of those data to determine global and internal properties of the stars. Reading lists and problem sets are provided, and data necessary for the problem sets are available online.The first book to describe in detail the different techniques used to analyze the data on stellar oscillations, Asteroseismic Data Analysis offers an invaluable window into the hearts of stars.Introduces the asteroseismic study of stars and the theory of stellar {oscillationsDescribes} the analysis of observational (time-domain) {dataExamines} how seismic parameters are extracted from {observationsExplores} how stellar properties are determined from seismic {dataLooks} at the “inverse problem,” where frequencies are used to infer internal structures of stars},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early red-giant star {KIC} 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the dipole mixed modes obtained from \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashit Kepler\} observations. In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashDelta} r=0.001R{\textbackslash} and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of about \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlangle{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_c/2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi{\textbackslash}textbackslashrangle=748{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm18\{{\textbackslash}{textasciitildenHz} and provide evidence for an angular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of the hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning shell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashlangle{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}\_s/2{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi{\textbackslash}textbackslashrangle=68{\textbackslash}textbackslashpm22\{{\textbackslash}{textasciitildenHz}. Hence, the core in {KIC}{\textbackslash}textasciitilde4448777 is rotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope. We conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

Such relations would be desirable for galactic archaeology, which uses stellar ages to map the history of the Milky Way. The ages of red giants must instead be estimated with reference to grids of theoretical stellar models, which can be computationally intensive. Here I present an exhaustive search for scaling age relations involving different combinations of observable quantities. The candidate scaling relations are calibrated and tested using more than 1,000 red giant stars whose ages were obtained via grid-based modeling. I report multiple high-quality scaling relations for red giant branch stars, the best of which are shown to be approximately as accurate as grid-based modeling with typical uncertainties of 15\%.

	abstract = {Since the first observations of solar oscillations in 1962, helioseismology has probably been one of the most successful fields of astrophysics. Besides the improvement of observational data, solar seismologists developed sophisticated techniques to infer the internal structure of the Sun. Back in the 1990s these comparisons showed a very high agreement between solar models and the Sun. However, the downward revision of the {CNO} surface abundances in the Sun in 2005, confirmed in 2009, induced a drastic reduction of this agreement leading to the so-called solar modelling problem. More than ten years later, in the era of the space-based photometry missions which have established asteroseismology of solar-like stars as a standard approach to obtain their masses, radii and ages, the solar modelling problem still awaits a solution. I will briefly present the results of new helioseismic inversions, discuss the current uncertainties of solar models and possible solutions to the solar modelling problem. I will also discuss how the solar problem can have significant implications for asteroseismology as a whole by discussing the modelling of the exoplanet-host star Kepler-444, thus impacting the fields requiring a precise and accurate knowledge of stellar masses, radii and ages, such as Galactic archaeology and exoplanetology.},

Because the Sun's rotation frequency is of the same order as that of the waves, it is now necessary to refine our description of wave propagation and to take into account the action of the Coriolis acceleration in a coherent way. To achieve this goal, we adopt the traditional approximation, which can be applied to stellar radiation zones under conditions that are given. We present the modified transport equations and their numerical evaluation in a parameter range that is significant for the Sun. Consequences for the transport of angular momentum inside solar and stellar radiative regions are discussed.},

For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications. Aims: We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. Methods: We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. Results: We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

	abstract = {The thesis topic is the stochastic excitation of the solar p-modes by turbulent convection, and the work consists of four parts: three theoretical sections and one observational. In the first section of the thesis, an explicit calculation of the acoustic radiation of a buoyant oscillating bubble is presented as a model for the excitation of the solar p-modes. The central scientific issue addressed in this work is the cancellation of monopole and dipole radiation fields in an anisotropic medium, first pointed out by Goldreich and Kumar (1990). When the bubble oscillation frequency is small compared to the acoustic cutoff, the monopole and dipole disturbances cancel to the quadrupole order in the far field. The second section deals with the role of convective structures in a wide number of problems, including the creation of acoustic disturbances, the transport of heat and magnetic fields, and the penetration of flows into stable layers of the atmosphere (overshoot). A model of plume convection is developed to discuss these issues. It is argued that the scaleheight-sized flows (the only energetically significant ones) are properly characterized as coherent, entropy-preserving plumes, in contradistinction to the picture of amorphous parcels of fluid suggested by the Mixing Length Theory, and in spite of the large Reynolds numbers typical in astrophysical convection. The third section of the thesis is an analysis of high-resolution surface velocity data taken with a magneto-optical filter on the 10 inch telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. Estimates are obtained for the frequencies and amplitudes of the solar oscillations of high spherical harmonic degree (l approximately less than 2000). The observed mode energies follow a Boltzmann distribution (P(E) varies as exp(-E/(bar-E)), as is predicted in the stochastic excitation model. In the final section of the thesis, a derivation of the variational principle for an incompressible fluid is presented. The Lagrange and Hamiltonian densities are calculated to third order in the displacement field, and these results are suitable to study the non-linear interactions among incompressible modes.},

	shorttitle = {When Gaussian Process Meets Big Data},
	abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process ({GP}) regression, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable {GPs} have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable {GPs} in the {GP} community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable {GPs} involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable {GPs} are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementation of scalable {GPs} in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

	abstract = {Context: The observations of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars have brought important constraints on their internal rotation rates. To correctly reproduce these data, an efficient transport mechanism is needed in addition to meridional circulation and shear instability. Aims: We study the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results: The precise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates available for the six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum needed for each of these subgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the uncertainties related to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence phase. An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants (typical values of log(g) close to 4), because their rotational properties are sensitive to the degree of radial differential rotation on the main sequence. These young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain the transport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic observations of evolved stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency of the additional transport process increases with the mass of the star during the subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined mechanism decreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found for red giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that increases with the degree of radial differential rotation cannot account for the core rotation rates of subgiants, while it correctly reproduces the rotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature of the additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum may be different in subgiant and red giant stars.},

	abstract = {We derive the scaling of differential rotation in both slowly- and rapidly-rotating convection zones using order of magnitude methods. Our calculations apply across stars and fluid planets and all rotation rates, as well as to both magnetized and purely hydrodynamic systems. We find shear \{{\textbackslash}{textbarR}{\textbackslash}textbackslashnabla{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash} of order the angular frequency \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash} for slowly-rotating systems with \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega} {\textbackslash}textbackslashll {\textbackslash}{textbarN}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}, where {\textbackslash}N{\textbackslash} is the {\textbackslash}textbackslashbrvs{\textbackslash}textbackslash frequency, and find that it declines as a power-law in \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega}{\textbackslash} for rapidly-rotating systems with \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashOmega} {\textbackslash}textbackslashgg {\textbackslash}{textbarN}{\textbackslash}textbar{\textbackslash}. We further calculate the meridional circulation rate and baroclinicity and examine the magnetic field strength in the rapidly rotating limit. Our results are in general agreement with simulations and observations and we perform a detailed comparison with those in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {Differential rotation is central to a great many mysteries in stars and planets. In Part I we predicted the order of magnitude and scaling of the differential rotation in both hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic convection zones. Our results apply to both slowly- and rapidly-rotating systems, and provide a general picture of differential rotation in stars and fluid planets. We further calculated the scalings of the meridional circulation, entropy gradient and baroclinicity. In this companion paper we compare these predictions with a variety of observations and numerical simulations. With a few exceptions we find that these are consistent in both the slowly-rotating and rapidly-rotating limits. Our results help to localize core-envelope shear in red{\textbackslash}textasciitildegiant stars, suggest a rotation-dependent frequency shift in the internal gravity waves of massive stars and potentially explain observed deviations from von Zeipel's gravity darkening in late-type stars.},

We adopted the Bayesian inference code {DIAMONDS} for the peak bagging analysis and asteroseismic splitting inversion methods to derive the internal rotational profile of the star. The detection of new splittings of mixed modes, which are more concentrated in the very inner part of the helium core, allowed us to reconstruct the angular velocity profile deeper into the interior of the star and to disentangle the details better than in Paper I: the helium core rotates almost rigidly about 6 times faster than the convective envelope, while part of the hydrogen shell seems to rotate at a constant velocity about 1.15 times lower than the He core. In particular, we studied the internal shear layer between the fast-rotating radiative interior and the slow convective zone and we found that it lies partially inside the hydrogen shell above r;0.05R and extends across the core–envelope boundary. Finally, we theoretically explored the possibility for the future capabilty to sound the convective envelope in the red-giant stars and we concluded that the inversion of a set of splittings with only low-harmonic degree l3, even supposing a very large number of modes, will not allow us to resolve the rotational profile of this region in detail.},
