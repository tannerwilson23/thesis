It is genuinely surprising that I am writing this section at the end of a long but rewarding three and a half years. I know exactly when I was set on this path towards a PhD in Astrophysics. I was in year 10 at Bendigo South East Secondary College, attending a VCE information evening, deciding what my units would be in year 11. Previous to that night, I thought I wanted to teach music. That night, I decided to do Gen B mathematics, the precursor to Specialist Mathematics. I’m unsure why I chose to do this unit; maybe I thought maths was fun(?) I now realise I was a correct intuition on my behalf, but as a 15-year-old, I had no idea what maths really was, to be honest. That decision to pursue science over the arts, and some fantastic physics and maths teachers in years 11 and 12 (shoutout to Mark and Luigi), pushed me to fall in love with physics and astronomy and follow my passion at Monash University, where I studied a Bachelor of Science and majored in Physics and Astronomy.

Over the next 4 years, I met many amazing and passionate students, including every member of the Monash Advanced Science and Science Scholar Society, who, through my competitive streak, pushed me to work as hard as possible. I would like to mention Alex Heger and Amanda Karakas, who let me, as an undergraduate student, complete projects with them and gave me my first taste of what it means to research. Alex, you also took me on as a student in my Honours year, allowed me to learn and grow in my early academic career and pushed me to achieve the grades required to enter the post-graduate program at Monash. Thank you.

To my supervisor, Andy: you are one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. I want to thank you for allowing me to be your student. Your advice and expectations have pushed me to become and improve myself as a scientist over the past 3 years. I will never forget the lessons you have taught me. Looking back over some of my early work, it is night and day, and I wouldn’t have been able to do any of this without you. So, next time, the beer is on me.

To Ilya: thank you for always being there to talk about anything. From the impact of Supernovae on binaries to Shakespeare and Russian Poetry, you were always ready to talk about anything. I will never forget your advice when I met you in your office once when I was worried about something about my research: “We aren’t curing cancer”. I interpreted this as “it’s supposed to be fun”. I really appreciate the irony of that memory as I, for the life of me, cannot remember what I was worried about. Yet, your quote is always in my mind while I work.

I want to give a special shoutout to the Low-mass stellar group. Our weekly meetings have made me learn so much, especially how to communicate my science. I have loved learning about the amazing work you all do weekly.

To all of my many office mates over the past three years, despite not being able to be in the office for nearly two of those years. Thank you for always being down for a chat. Special shoutout to Giulia, Maddy and Avi, who have pushed me to be a better scientist and whom I am grateful to call my friends.

To my best friends Isaac and Tom: you will always be my rock. When I am down and stressed, I can always turn to you for advice or a quick laugh. I appreciate everything that you do for me. Thank you, Tom and Kit, for letting me move in with you when I had no other options (bloody covid). You helped me get through the long days, and I’ll always be so thankful for you. 

I would also like to thank my parents. Mum and Dad, thank you for supporting me and allowing me to explore and work as hard as possible to complete this. I could not have done this without your support and love. To my brothers Jordan and Riley: I appreciate you being a part of my life and supporting whatever I do.

To my partner Hannah: I’m so glad I met you. Thank you for putting up with the long nights and the partial breakdowns and making me remember what this all means. I love you.

Finally, I have to thank my dog, Spencer, who, while writing, is behind me snoring.
