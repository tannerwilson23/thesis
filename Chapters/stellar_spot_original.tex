\label{chap:stellar_spots}

\section*{Preamble}

The effects of rotation can permeate astronomy in unexpected ways.
The number of stellar spots expressed by stars is directly tied to the surface rotation rate through increased magnetic field strength.
Stars with relatively fast rotation rates express larger surface spot coverage than those with slow rotation rates \citep{cao_starspots_2022}.
While stellar spots are useful in determining the surface rotation of stars, through periodic brightness variations, they have also been obtrusive in other areas.
For example, they can mimic transits of exoplanets in light curves.

In this work, we investigate the effect of stellar spots on the inferred atmospheric parameters of stars through spectroscopy.
We adopt a simple two-temperature model of the stellar atmosphere to reflect the impact of stellar spots on the stellar atmosphere.
With this model, we generate synthetic spotted spectra of a population of stars with physically motivated stellar and spot parameters
Then, we investigate the effect of fitting spotted spectra with non-spotted models of the stellar atmosphere.
We find that, even in this simple model of the impact of spots on the stellar atmosphere stellar spots can introduce bias and scatter to inferred atmospheric parameters.
The introduced scatter is particularly impactful to the precise measurement of stellar metallicity.
